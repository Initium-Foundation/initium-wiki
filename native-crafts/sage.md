# Sage

Sage is an oracle project of Initium Labs. Sage project is defined as an oracle protocol that can be used for trading binary options and is capable of price updates every 400ms with Initium architecture, with developers using Sage to build DeFi assets and marketplaces.

Sage is a decentralized oracle network that will provide decentralization at both the oracle and data source levels. By using multiple independent Sage nodes, the users can defend against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly, using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the users can defend against one data source being a single source of truth.

Sage Oracle will be an open-source project and Initium Labs will announce further information about it.&#x20;
