# Sage

Sage is the blockchain-based oracle being developed for the Initium blockchain. Sage oracle is a third-party service that connects the iCrafts with the outside world, primarily to feed information from the world and the reverse. Data from the world encapsulates multiple sources so that decentralized knowledge is obtained.

Initium Labs aims to develop and implement the Sage oracle as a cross-chain oracle enabling Initium crafts to exchange data with the smart contracts on the other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.) and vice-versa. Further information on Sage oracle is available on the Sage [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.initium.foundation).&#x20;
