# Evander

Evander is one of the major open-source projects that initium Labs plans to develop as a native solution for Etheruem-like dApps. Evander is an EVM that will allow Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on Initium, taking full advantage of the functionality native to Initium, including the ability to execute transactions in parallel. As such, the Evander EVM allows dApps to operate with the low gas fees, high transaction speed, and high throughput of Initium while offering access to the Initium ecosystem. The Evander will allow any Ethereum application to be run on Initium without any changes to its codebase, including Uniswap, SushiSwap, 0x, and MakerDAO. All essential Ethereum dApp tools can also work on Solana, including Solidity, MetaMask, Remix, and Truffle.&#x20;

Initium Labs will publish further information about Evander. &#x20;
