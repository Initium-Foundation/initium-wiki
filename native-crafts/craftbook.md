# CraftBook

Initium CraftBook (ICB) is a collection of on-chain crafts and recipes targeting the Castor parallel runtime. These programs will be tested against Initium's implementation of Castor and Initium runtime and deployed to the Hadron network. CraftBook helps the developers to deploy their projects, assets, and crafts on the Initium protocol.&#x20;

Initium Lab will regularly update the Initium CfratBook. A community guide for Initium CraftBook will be available on https://craftbook.wiki.&#x20;

Here is a list of the crafts of Initium CraftBook:

### Token Craft

### Verto Craft

Verto is a token swap exchange like Uniswap and Balancer that allows simple trading of token pairs without a centralized limit order book. The program uses a mathematical formula called "curve" to calculate the price of all trades. Curves aim to mimic normal market dynamics: for example, as traders buy a lot of one token type, the value of the other token type goes up.

Depositors in the pool provide liquidity for the token pair. That liquidity enables trade execution at a spot price. In exchange for their liquidity, depositors receive pool tokens, representing their fractional ownership in the pool. A program withholds a portion of the input token during each trade as a fee. That fee increases the value of pool tokens stored in the pool.

### Memo Craft

Memo is a simple craft that validates a string of UTF-8 encoded characters and verifies that any accounts provided are signers of the transaction. The program also logs the memo and any verified signer addresses to the transaction log, so anyone can easily observe memos and know zero or more addresses approved them by inspecting the transaction log from a trusted provider.

### Name Service Craft

Name Service is a craft for issuing and managing ownership of domain names, Solana Pubkeys, URLs, Twitter handles, ipfs CIDs, etc. This craft will be used for DNS and pubkey lookups via a browser extension. The goal is to create an easy way to identify Initium public keys with various links.
