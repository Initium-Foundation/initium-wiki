# Introduction

An Initium Native Craft (INC) is a software application built in a specific programming language for the Initium protocol. Generally, each INC will be designed and implemented to enable users, especially developers, to develop ideas and projects based on the Initium technology. Initium Labs will create the Initium Native Apps, and the Blox members can contribute to this process.

Initium Native Crafts will be developed in Rust, C, JavaScript, TypeScrip, and Go languages.&#x20;
