# RedWrap

RedWrap is Initium's cross-chain bridge that enables the exchange of information, cryptocurrency, and  NFTs from one Initium network to other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygone, etc.) and vice versa. It enables the flow of data and tokens across what would otherwise be siloed sets of data on different blockchains. RedWrap will be available on [https://wrap.red](https://wrap.red). Further information on RedWrap is available on the RedWap [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.initium.foundation).&#x20;
