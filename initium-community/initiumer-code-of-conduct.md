# Initiumer Code of Conduct

### OVERVIEW

The Initium community comprises professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working in many different capacities, including writing code, leading working groups, managing events, and more.

Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can sometimes lead to miscommunication and conflict. To ensure that all of our contributors feel welcome and valued, the **Initumer Code of Conduct** establishes clear expectations for participants in the Foundation's work. It is not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of prohibited behavior but rather a set of principles for maintaining a healthy and inclusive community.

This code of conduct applies to all activities managed by Initium Community. This includes the Foundation's developer pod, forums, mailing lists, Discord servers, social media, Jira, Confluence, GitHub resources, conference calls, in-person events, and any other forum established or managed by the Initium Foundation for community collaboration. In some cases, violations of this code outside of the Initium Foundation's scope may affect a person's ability to participate in our community.

The code of conduct also applies to every member of the Initium community, including Initium Foundation staff, members, project maintainers, volunteers, event participants, sponsors, and vendors.

### Reporting Violation&#x20;

If you observe or are subject to a violation of these rules at a Foundation event, please report the matter to any FINOS representative on-site. Please report any other code of conduct violations by emailing [community@initium.foundation](mailto:community@initium.foundation). We are committed to protecting the safety and privacy of anyone who reports a violation.

### CODE OF CONDUCT

As an Initiumer, you are expected to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate.** Other people will use your work, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should consider those consequences when making decisions. Remember that we're a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful.** People working together will inevitably disagree or become frustrated with one another at times, but conflict is no excuse for bad behavior or personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Be respectful of those outside our community who interact with us.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Refrain from all forms of harassment, including:
* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **Be understanding.** Strive to resolve disagreements constructively. Our contributors come from different backgrounds and have different perspectives. If you disagree with someone, seek to understand their perspective and share yours respectfully.
