# Community Events

There are two types of community events in the Initium ecosystem as followings:

### Covenant Grand Event

In these events, the Initiumers will meet the core teams of the projects, Initium Foundation's business partners, Initium Ambassadors, Contributors, Premiums, and even Primes. The calendar of Covenant events will be available on the Initium Foundation and Initium Team websites.

### Initiumer Meetups

The community meetups in the Initium ecosystem are called Initiumer Meetups. Every Initumer Meetup is a public event (live or online) for the Initiumers to meet each other. The Initium Chapters can organize these events (e.g., Initiumer USA, Initiumer Europe, etc.). The information on the Initiumer Meetups is available on the Initium Foundation website.
