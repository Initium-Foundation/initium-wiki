# Community Events

The community events in the Initium ecosystem are called Initiumer Events. The Initumer events are public events (live or online) for the Initiumers to meet each other. These events can be organized by the Initium Chapters (e.g., Initiumer USA, Initiumer Europe, etc). The information on the Initiumer events is available on the Initium Foundation and Initium Team websites.&#x20;

In these events, the Initiumers will meet the core teams of the projects, Initium Foundation's business partners, Initium Ambassadors, Contributors, Premiums, and even Primes.&#x20;
