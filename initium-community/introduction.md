# Introduction

The Initium community plays an essential role in the success of the ecosystem. The Initium community is a globally distributed home to developers, token holders, validators, and members supporting the protocol.&#x20;

The Initium community members can join the [initium-premium.md](../about-initium/initium-premium.md "mention") program to help Initium supporters contribute to the ecosystem and work with core teams. The ecosystem needs you no matter your passion â€” community management, content creation, social media, events, tech support, or anything else.

### The Initiumer

In the Initium ecosystem, we address the community members as the Initiumer. An Initiumer is an individual, team, organization, institution, or group contributing to the Initium ecosystem.
