# Glossary of Terms

## A

## Absolute Advantage

An economics concept in which one party has a direct advantage in efficiency in producing/providing a specific good or service over another party.

## Address

Much like an address in the real world, or a website, an address on the blockchain relates to the string of text given to identify a particular place or user. More specifically it is the string of text that designates the location of a particular wallet on the blockchain, that can be used to send or receive digital assets.

All blockchains have wallet addresses in some form, and most take the form of a long string of letters and numbers in a line of text that is difficult for a human to interpret but easily understood by a computer network. For example, a Bitcoin address will look something like the following:\
1CKa7k7RtaV4TRRcnjciVndBS8hXXXXX

And an address on the Ethereum network might look like the following:\
0x77dce4813eXXXX50e57E1b999c197aad00bEc1c2

Given the public nature of most blockchains, it is possible to see how much, and which type, of digital assets most wallets contain - though this is not true for private blockchains or privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero.

## Airdrop

In the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, the term “Airdrop” refers to the distribution of digital assets to the public, either by virtue of holding a certain other token or simply by virtue of being an active wallet address on a particular blockchain.

This is separate and distinct from the allocation of tokens or coins that happen via an ICO event. During ICOs, the digital asset being offered is typically purchased using an alternate coin or token. In the case of airdrops, there is no purchase required from the recipient, meaning that the assets are distributed for free.

Airdrops are often used as a marketing tool in order to raise awareness of the coin or token that is being distributed, as well as a method of diversifying the number of holders of that asset.The way in which airdrops typically work is that in order to be eligible, a user must hold a certain amount of the asset in a public wallet at the time of the snapshot that is taken as a view of the current state of the blockchain at that particular point in time.

## Algorithm

In computer science, an algorithm consists of a sequence of unambiguous instructions that conduct computer programs to perform a variety of tasks. They can be designed to execute a simple action like subtracting two numbers, or more complex operations, like finding the best route between two or more geographic locations. As such, computer algorithms are extremely useful for performing all sorts of tasks, from calculations, data processing, and even decision-making.&#x20;

Every algorithm is made of a fixed beginning and ending point, producing outputs according to the inputs and the predefined steps. Multiple algorithms can be combined to perform more elaborate tasks, but higher complexity also requires more computational resources.&#x20;

Algorithms can be measured by their correctness and efficiency. Correctness refers to the algorithm’s accuracy and whether or not it can solve a certain problem. Efficiency is related to the amount of resources, and time an algorithm needs to perform a particular task. Many computer scientists use a mathematical analysis technique known as asymptotic to compare different algorithms, regardless of the programming language or hardware they are running on.

## All or None Order (AON)

An All or None order, often abbreviated to AON is an order made on a financial exchange to buy or sell a volume of assets for a set price. However, unlike other order types such as a market order or limit order, an All or None order is placed with a specific instruction as to how that order should be filled.&#x20;

As the name suggests, an AON order, once placed, must either be filled in its entirety or not at all. This prevents any partial filling of orders and gives the buyer or seller confidence of the fixed execution price for the entire volume.

This type of order can be used, for instance, in algorithmic trading as a way to gauge the directional trend of a market and to prevent partial fill situations, which may happen when a market presents high levels of volatility with low volumes, such as during a flash crash type event.

## All-Time High (ATH)

The term “All-Time High” relates to the highest price that an asset has achieved in exchange, for the current trading pair that is being referenced.

## Allocation

Allocation is an allotment of tokens or equity, that may be earned, purchased, or set aside for a certain investor, team, group, organization, or other related entity.

For a crypto team in its whitepaper stages, the executive team or community may work on deciding what allocations of tokens should be divided up into different initiatives and departments, such as development, marketing, operational costs, and so on. If a team has a foundation or other entity that is in control of funds, it may also decide to create an allocation for a token treasury to be utilized as specified by the team or community.

Investors can also receive allocations in rounds of investments. For example, a team may sell allocations of a set “ticket size”, or maximum amount, to early investors in a private sale round. In this case, each of these individual investing parties would own an allocation out of the total amount offered on that particular round of sale. An individual entity may have the potential to hold allocations from multiple rounds of sale, which means they could eventually participate in different stages of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or token sale event, with a predefined allocation for each stage. &#x20;

Team members working on a specific coin, protocol, or project may also receive part of a team allocation as a reward for their work. For instance, these allocations could be paid out all at once at a certain date - such as the date of a token generation event (TGE) - or spread out over time, following a predefined schedule.&#x20;

In certain situations, the allocations are distributed over time as part of a block reward or over a vesting period or cliff.

## Alpha&#x20;

A measurement of an investment strategy's ability to exceed the average growth of the wider market.

## Alpha Code

Early-stage prototype computer code, programs, and algorithms meant to solve a problem, and/or provide new digital goods or services. Alpha software comes with the expectation that the code is at an early prototype stage and is meant for an early testing phase meant for very limited testing.

Alpha code or software may be missing all or parts of expected software functionality. Planned features and the security of the software may also be very limited or even non-existent in many aspects.

## Altcoin

Altcoin is the term given to describe alternative digital assets, such as a coin or token that is not Bitcoin. This nomenclature comes from the idea that Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and that all others are then considered “alternate” or “alternative” coins.

The term “altcoin” is also used quite broadly to refer to digital assets that would also technically be referred to as “tokens” rather than coins. The best-known examples are the ERC-20 tokens that exist on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Angel Investor

Also called a seed or private investor, angel investors actively seek out opportunities to provide funding for entrepreneurs or start-up companies. They are often individuals with high net worth who are seeking new methods of expanding their wealth while simultaneously helping to launch an up-and-coming venture.

By investing, angel investors are not simply loaning funds to a project or company. Instead, they often require some percentage of ownership in the venture based on their initial investment. In some cases, the investment may occur continually, as the enterprise develops. But, it may also take place as a one-time contribution that helps the venture get started.&#x20;

Angel investing tends to be beneficial for both the entrepreneur and the early investor. For example, the investor may find an opportunity to capitalize on earning interest at a rate they will not find in the standard financial market. For the entrepreneur, they are receiving funding at a level they may not otherwise have access to by applying to the typical loan entities, especially as a start-up.&#x20;

Angel investors play a significant role in economic growth. Outside of their potential personal gains by investing in a start-up, their funding helps to launch innovative ventures. Many of which would otherwise never exist, given the limited access to traditional funding sources. These ventures, in turn, help to create jobs and contribute new products and services to the economy.

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

Anti-money laundering (AML) is a broad term for laws and regulations put in place to prevent criminals from making money illegally or moving illicit funds. While many illegal activities are targeted by AML laws, some of the most important are tax evasion, public corruption, and market manipulation through methods such as wash trading.

## Application Programming Interface (API)

An application programming interface, or API, is a piece of code that allows two applications to share information.

A good example of an API is an aggregator site for hotel bookings. The aggregator site uses APIs to request information from different hotel chains in response to a customer’s request. For example, the customer requests information on available rooms that meet specific criteria – the start and end date for the stay, geographical area, and cost. This information is sent to the hotel’s systems using an API, which translates the request into a format that the hotel servers can understand. These systems then reply through the API with the rooms they have available that match these criteria.\
\
The API enables the information to be exchanged quickly and easily despite the aggregator site and the hotel system being built with different technology and by different companies.\
\
In this scenario, the hotel is the API provider. It has built the API to enable other Apps to access the information. The hotel does this because it wants to make it easy for users to find out about its available rooms. The aggregator site is the consumer of the API. It uses the API because it would be either impossible or too much work to obtain the data it needs without one.

## Audit

An audit is either an internal or independent comprehensive review of a concept, system, process, company, or product. A comprehensive audit includes a thoughtful and in-depth look at the structure, strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities of the thing or process being audited.

Audits may be either informal or formal audits and are meant to be a tool to find and analyze weaknesses, so that issues and problems discovered during an audit may be remediated, mitigated, or corrected.

## APY

Annual Percentage Yield is a time-based measurement of the Return On Investment (ROI) on an asset. For example, $100 invested at 2% APY would yield $102 after one year, if there is no compounding of any interest earned on that $100 through the year. Assuming a static APY rate, the Monthly ROI would be 0.16%, in this case. For more information [click here](initium-ecosystem/crypto-economics/teminology.md#annual-percentage-yield-apy).

## Arbitrage

The trading of a coin or crypto derivative, where the price spread between two different markets or exchanges for the same asset or product is utilized to earn greater profits.

Arbitrage is the practice of buying and selling assets over two or more markets as a way to take advantage of different prices. For instance, a trader could buy a particular asset in one market and quickly sell the same asset in another market, at a higher price.

The reason why arbitrage exists is due to inefficiencies in the markets. This means that a particular asset may present distinct trading prices in different locations, even though both markets are offering the exact same asset (or very similar ones).

In the context of financial markets, arbitrage is often considered a fundamental force because it prevents distinct markets from creating significant price disparities among similar or identical assets. Therefore, the practice of arbitrage relies on small price divergences and, as a result, tends to cause a price convergence. The speed at which this convergence occurs may be used as a measure of the overall market efficiency. A perfectly efficient market would present no arbitrage opportunities at all as each trading asset would have the exact same price across all exchanges.

When performed correctly, arbitrage may be considered a risk-free way to capitalize on temporary price disparities. Still, one should keep in mind that trading bots are running on all kinds of markets and many of them were specially designed to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Therefore, arbitrage trading may present some risks depending on the strategy and execution.

In DeFi, automated yield farming uses algorithmic arbitrage strategies to maximize returns for investors. These arbitrage strategies may include buying, selling, lending, and/or providing liquidity of one or more digital assets, often on the same day.

## Automated Market Maker

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized asset trading pool that enables market participants to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. AMMs are non-custodial and permissionless in nature. Most AMMs utilize either a constant product, constant mean, or constant sum market-making formula; however, the most common is a constant product market maker, most notably Uniswap and CoreSwap.&#x20;

## Ask Price

In traditional financial markets, the buy and sell orders that are placed on a specific market are called bids and asks. While bids are offers in a base currency for a unit of the trading asset, asks are the selling prices set by those holding the asset and looking to sell. Therefore, the asking price is the minimum price that an individual would be willing to sell their asset, or the minimum amount that they want to receive in return for the unit they are parting with.

## Asset Management

Asset management refers to any kind of method or system that helps individuals or companies manage their assets. These assets may be represented by both physical goods (like a house, an apartment, or a car) or non-physical ones (like copyrights, patents, cryptocurrencies, or other digital assets).

## Atomic Swap

Atomic swap is a technology based on smart contracts that enables the exchange of different cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized market or other intermediaries. Also known as atomic cross-chain trading, atomic swaps involve the trade of one cryptocurrency to another, even if they are running in different blockchain networks.\


## Auction

Auctions are live events where various items, ranging from furniture to real estate, can be purchased through a bidding process. When the item is first presented at the auction, the auctioneer (person responsible for leading and managing the bidding process), will pitch a starting bid to the audience.

Once bidding begins, interested persons will offer competing bids until no one is willing to go any higher with their bid price. Once the auctioneer recognizes the final bid, that person will be declared the highest bidder. The auction concludes with the highest bidder paying for and claiming the item. A sizable number of potential buyers is usually desired, as this may result in the bids being driven up to higher values for an optimal sale.

## B

## Bags

In the crypto space, the word bag refers to the coins and tokens one is holding as part of their portfolio. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. There is no defined minimum, but when the value is relatively high, one could say they are holding “heavy bags” of a certain coin or token.

## Bear Market

The term bear market refers to a negative trend in the prices of a market. It is widely used not only in the cryptocurrency space but also in the traditional markets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities markets.

Generally speaking, a bear market refers to a strong market downtrend that presents significant falling prices over a relatively short period of time. When compared to traditional markets, cryptocurrency markets are smaller and thus more volatile. Therefore, it is quite common to see stronger and prolonged crypto bear markets, where 85% price drops are not that rare.

## Benchmark

In short, a benchmark is a standard that functions as a point of reference. Within the financial industry, a benchmark is a measurement standard which can be used to gauge the performance of a particular asset or investment portfolio. Among the most common forms of benchmarks are the so-called indexes, which are basically financial instruments used to represent a group of individual market prices or a collection of data points.\


## BEP-20

BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain’s BEP-2 and Ethereum’s ERC-20, it’s compatible with both.

## Beta Code

Later stage prototype computer code, programs, and algorithms meant to solve a problem, and/or provide digital goods or services. Beta code comes with the expectation that the code has more functionality and stability than a mid-to-late stage prototype stage with a Beta testing phase, and that the software functionality, features, and security may still be limited.

The codebase, process, system, and/or network is often opened up to a limited number of testers who stress test systems and provide feedback for improvements to the developer or development team.

Beta code development has the expectation of being one of the critical final phases before the potential public release of Version 1.0 software. Beta software is used with the expectation and understanding that there may still be minor to fatal bugs or security vulnerabilities are hidden within this Beta software code or associated processes that may not have been uncovered by previous security reviews, testing, or audits.

## Bid Price

The bid price is the highest price that a particular buyer is willing to pay for a specific product or service. In the context of financial markets, it is the value buyers offer for an asset, such as a commodity, security, or cryptocurrency. A trading order book consists of multiple bid prices (on the side of buyers) and asking prices (on the side of sellers). The highest bid price is always lower than the lowest asking price and the difference between them is referred to as a bid-ask spread.

Traders or investors that are willing to sell their assets or stock positions need to either accept one of the bid prices available on the order book (ideally, the highest one) or to set an asking price and wait until a buyer eventually bids against that value, filling the order.&#x20;

## Bid-Ask Spread

The concept is known as the bid-ask spread because it is the gap between the lowest asking price (sell order) and the highest bid price (buy order).

Basically, the bid-ask spread may be formed in two different ways. First, it can be created by a broker (or trading intermediary) as a way of monetize for their service. Second, it can be created just by the differences between the limit orders placed by traders on an open market.

## Bitcoin

In short, Bitcoin is a digital form of money that runs on a distributed network of computers (nodes). In a broader sense, though, many people often use the word Bitcoin to refer to a few different things: a digital currency, a decentralized public ledger, a protocol, or simply the big ecosystem that encompasses all of these. However, there are some fundamental differences between these functionalities.

## Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core is the leading implementation of the software enabling users to interact with the Bitcoin network. It is not owned by any single business or organization but is instead updated and reviewed by a community of worldwide developers. The software was initially released by Satoshi Nakamoto (under the name Bitcoin), only to be later renamed Bitcoin Core to avoid any confusion.

## Bitcoin Dominance

Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (market cap) and commands a large portion of the trading volume (and the attention) in the cryptocurrency markets. If we look at the summative market capitalizations of all the existing cryptocurrencies, then we can arrive at a total market cap valuation for the entire cryptocurrency space. Therefore, Bitcoin dominance is described as the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin to the rest of the cryptocurrency markets.

## Block

In short, the term block refers to computer files that store transaction data. These blocks are arranged in a linear sequence that forms an endless chain of blocks - hence, the term blockchain. So all information about blockchain transactions is gathered and recorded inside these blocks, and every newly generated block is connected to the previous one through the use of cryptographic techniques.The chain of linked blocks stores all the transaction data generated since the launch of a particular blockchain. So the records go all the way back to the first block, which is referred to as the block zero or genesis block. The number of confirmed blocks since the genesis block is denoted as the block height.\


## Block Explorer

In short, a block explorer is a tool that provides detailed analytics about a blockchain network since its first day at the genesis block. We can say a block explorer acts as a search engine and browser where users can find information about individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions associated with a specific cryptocurrency.

Depending on the type of blockchain, block explorers can also serve as a general information hub. For instance, there are thousands of ERC-20 tokens running on top of the Ethereum blockchain, and users can find data about them by checking their smart contracts on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) or other Ethereum block explorers.

## Block Reward

Block reward refers to the cryptocurrency rewarded to a miner when they successfully validate a new block. The block reward is made of two components: the block subsidy and the transactions fees. The block subsidy consists of newly generated coins and represents the biggest part of a block reward. The other part is made up of all fees paid by the transactions that are included in the block.

Because the block reward is almost entirely made of the block subsidy, it is very common to see people talking about the block subsidy while referring to it as the block reward. So in popular terminology, the term “block reward” doesn’t account for the fees. In the case of Bitcoin, the block subsidy started at 50 BTC and is being reduced by half every 210,000 blocks (approximately once every four years). Such a process is known as Bitcoin halving. Bitcoin’s block subsidy was reduced to 25 BTC in 2012, and to 12.5 BTC in 2016. The last halving took place in May 2020. For more information on Initium Block Reward, please [click here](broken-reference).&#x20;

## Blockchain

Blockchain transactions occur within a peer-to-peer network of globally distributed computers (nodes). Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain and contributes to the functioning and security of the network. This is what makes Bitcoin a decentralized digital currency that is borderless, censorship-resistant, and that does not require third-party intermediation.

As a distributed ledger technology (DLT) the blockchain is intentionally designed to be highly resistant to modification and frauds (such as double-spending). This is true because the Bitcoin blockchain, as a database of records, cannot be altered, nor can it be tampered without an impractical amount of electricity and computational power - which means the network can enforce the concept of "original" digital documents, making each Bitcoin a very unique and un-copyable form of digital currency.

## Bounty

The term bounty refers to a reward posted by a group or individual to incentivize certain work, behavior, or development. For instance, referral programs may be considered a kind of bounty.In the context of cryptocurrencies, a bounty program is a marketing strategy used by startups during their initial coin offering (ICO) campaigns. It allows them to allocate a certain percentage of their coin’s supply to promote their project.

## Breakout

In technical analysis (TA), a breakout refers to the price of an asset moving above a resistance area, or below a support area. A breakout may indicate that the price of the asset will start trending in the direction of the breakout.

Breakouts that are accompanied by high volume may be considered a stronger signal than breakouts with average volume. If the volume is high, there is a higher chance that the price will start trending in the breakout direction. Breakouts can happen as a result of range or channel breakouts or price pattern breakouts, such as triangles, flags, wedges, or head and shoulders patterns. Breakouts are typically preceded by a period of decreased volatility.  Usually, the longer the pattern has developed, the more explosive the breakout will be. If the levels are clearly defined, many traders may use the same price levels to set their stop-loss orders. Once those stop orders start getting triggered, they might create a cascading effect resulting in a rapid price movement.

The hypothesis behind breakout trading is quite simple. If support and resistance levels keep the price contained in a range, the break of that range might indicate a larger move.

Breakout trading can be applied to virtually any timeframe and style of trading.

A breakout can be either a buy or sell signal, depending on the direction of the move. A breakout trader may enter a long or short position once the price has moved outside of the defined support or resistance area.

It is important to note that, similar to other methods in technical analysis, breakouts can be subjective. The support and resistance levels and the chart patterns that provide the basis for the breakouts might be interpreted differently by different traders.&#x20;

If the price breaks outside of a defined range but quickly reverses, it may be considered a fakeout, or false breakout. This occurs when the price moves out of a defined range, but after a short period, moves back into the range.&#x20;

As a precautionary measure against fake-outs, some traders may wait for confirmation of the breakout on higher timeframes to enter a trade. This can also mean waiting for the breakout level to be retested as a newly formed support or resistance (depending on the direction) as an entry point.

## Bull Market

The term bull market refers to a positive trend in the prices of a market. It is broadly used not only in the cryptocurrency space but also in the traditional markets. In short, a bull market concerns to a strong market uptrend that presents meaningful rising prices over a relatively short period of time. When compared to traditional markets, cryptocurrency markets are smaller and consequently more volatile. Therefore, it is quite common to see strong and consistent bull runs, where a 40% price increase in 1 or 2 days is quite common.

## Buy Wall

A buy wall is the result of a single huge buy order or the composition of multiple large buy orders that are put at the same price in the order book of a particular market. Buy walls can be created by a wealthy individual, group of traders, or institutions. In cryptocurrency exchanges, trading is made via an order book, where buyers indicate their buying prices (bids) and sellers indicate their selling prices (asks). Essentially, buy walls prevent market prices from dropping because they create a massive amount of orders at the same price which requires large amounts of money to be executed and passed over. Buy or sell walls usually occur when large holders (whales) of any cryptocurrency want to control the prices to the best of their interest. Therefore, whale traders regularly create buy and sell walls in an attempt to manipulate the markets.

## C

## Candlestick

A candlestick is a graphical representation of the price action of a trading asset. It allows chartists and traders to visualize the open, high, low, and closing prices within a specific time period.

## Capitulation

Capitulation refers to a period of strong selling activity, where investors give up their positions and sell their holdings as quickly as possible. It is often referred to as panic selling because during a period of capitulation, sell orders peak at a much higher-than-average level, which quickly drives the asset price lower and lower until a bottom is eventually reached.

Capitulation can be described as the moment when investors lose hope - accepting losses and giving up their previous gains. When the panic selling period is over, marking the end of the capitulation, it may be followed by either a consolidating period (sideways price movements) or by an upward trend that would potentially indicate the beginning of a bull market.&#x20;

## CeFi

Centralized Finance. In terms of cryptocurrency, CeFi is represented by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses, or organizations with a physical address, and usually with some sort of corporate structure. These CeFi businesses must follow all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in each country, state, or region in which they operate.

## CEX

A CEX is a Centralized Exchange, with a physical address and a corporate structure. Like other CeFi businesses, a CEX must follow all applicable laws, rules, money transmitter licenses, and regulations in each country, state, or region in which they operate. There are significant overhead costs in running a CEX including Corporate leaders, labor, rent and electricity, office supplies, significant legal expenses, and expensive money transmitter licenses to be able to operate in chosen countries, states, or regions.

## Circulating Supply

The circulating supply refers to the coins that are accessible to the public and should not be confused with the total supply or max supply. The total supply is used to quantify the number of coins in existence, i.e., the number of coins that were already issued minus the coins that were burned. The total supply is basically the sum of the circulating supply and the coins that are locked up in escrow. On the other hand, the max supply quantifies the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist, including the coins that will be mined or made available in the future.

## Coin

A form of digital currency primarily used for payments or storage of wealth. Coins are secured by encryption algorithms. The market price of the coin represents the value of the ownership of a divisible unit of the coin or token (another name for a coin, but a type of coin with greater functionality) at a given moment in time. This coin or token can represent a share of the ownership and/or governance of a coin, token, protocol, company, or project and all of the benefits that this may entail.

## Collateralization

Collateralization is the use of a valuable asset to secure a loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may seize the asset and sell it to offset the loss. Collateralization of assets gives lenders a sufficient level of reassurance against default risk.\


## Composability

The measure of the usability and ability of the product to be used as a building block (or "money lego") in the construction of other products or domains. A protocol that is simple, powerful, and that functions well with other protocols would be considered to have high composability.

## Compound Interest

Once called the eighth wonder of the world by Einstein, compound interest allows greater interest rates and returns on investments by allowing interest gained to be automatically reinvested back in with the original deposits and accrued interest. This reinvestment period is based on the planned distribution of this interest which may be hourly, weekly, monthly, or annual interest distribution.

With compound interest, the greatest gains are often seen over a certain period in time, with a notably sharp rise in the value of investments seen at longer periods. In general, the longer a deposit benefits from compound interest, the much greater the overall gains when compared to gains made from simple interest.

## Confirmation Time

Confirmation time is defined as the time elapsed between the moment a blockchain transaction is submitted to the network and the time it is finally recorded into a confirmed block. In other words, it represents the total time a user has to wait until their transaction gets collected and confirmed by a miner node.&#x20;

Depending on the type of blockchain and network architecture, this time can be reduced by offering a higher transaction fee, so miners will have an incentive to give a higher priority to your transaction.\


## Custody

In financial circles, custody refers to the holding of assets on behalf of a client, generally by some form of institution. The use of a custodial service can be desirable to an asset holder, as it mitigates security risks like theft or loss.

Custodians tend to differ from banks as they’re unable to leverage the assets they hold to their own ends. For their troubles, the institution will generally impose a fee for the safekeeping of the assets. This may also cover their sale at the client’s behest.



## D

## Dead Cat Bounce

On Wall Street, the term dead cat bounce is used to describe a brief recovery in the price of a declining asset that is shortly followed by a continuation of the downtrend.

## Decentralized Application (DApp)

A 21st-century invention, a dApp is a decentralized Web3 application that normally runs on a blockchain. Advantages of dApps are that: they allow for new solutions to problems, they are decentralized and are thus rugged, and they are resistant to outages and censorship.

dApps can provide decentralized software application services - such as the Brave browser - but they can also be used to trace and track goods, and can be used to enable international financial transactions without the delay, costs, and hassle of middlemen and bureaucracy. They can also be a keystone to the functionality of complex decentralized exchanges and crypto financial services such as price oracles.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

The acronym DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In general, a DAO is a system of hard-coded rules that define which actions a decentralized organization will take. However, the term DAO may also refer specifically to an organization called “The DAO,” which was conceptualized on the Ethereum blockchain, back in 2016.

Simply put, a DAO refers to a particular kind of organization that, unlike conventional companies, is based on open source code and is operated entirely by its community. Therefore, the underlying structure and working mechanisms of a DAO are not based on any kind of hierarchical management (which are quite common in traditional businesses).

## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

\
An exchange that does not require users to deposit funds to start trading and does not hold the funds for the user. Instead, users trade directly from their own wallets.&#x20;

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi stands for “decentralized finance” and refers to the ecosystem comprised of financial applications that are being developed on top of blockchain systems. DeFi may be defined as the movement that promotes the use of decentralized networks and open-source software to create multiple types of financial services and products. The idea is to develop and operate financial DApps on top of a transparent and trustless framework, such as permissionless blockchains and other peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols.



## Delisting

Delisting is the removal of an asset from an exchange. It can happen either as a request from the project team or, resulting from the asset’s team or the asset itself no longer upholding the listing requirements provided by the exchange. There are numerous factors that could go into the decision for an exchange to delist an asset. Some of these factors are listed below:

* Overall team commitment to the project
* Quality and level of development activity
* Project network and/or smart contract stability
* Level of public communication from the project team
* Responsiveness to due diligence requests from an exchange
* Evidence of unethical or fraudulent behavior
* Whether the project is contributing to a healthy, sustainable blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem
* Other reasons, for which the exchange deems conducting business with the project unacceptable or risky

When an asset gets delisted from an exchange, all of its trading pairs are removed. The asset can still potentially be traded on other exchanges (such as decentralized exchanges), or through over-the-counter trading (OTC), but trading activity on the exchange that delisted that asset will cease. After the trading pairs associated with the delisted asset are removed, the assets withdrawals from the exchange will remain open for a specified period of time after the delisting. This way, users have the option to withdraw their existing funds kept on the exchange even though trading is no longer available on the platform.

## Design Flaw Attack

A design flaw attack refers to an attack in which a malicious user purposely creates a smart contract, decentralized market, or other software with knowledge of certain flaws in order to trick individuals interacting within the permissionless environment. A design flaw attack typically exhibits high apparent incentives for users to lock their funds into a smart contract. A flawed definition in some rules surrounding the contract, or the protocol on which it is built, may lead to unfair settlement or release of funds. A design flaw attack can also be conducted when a malicious user decides to exploit flaws on a contract that was created by another user without any malevolent intent. In this case, the attack would rely on information asymmetry between the attacker and any potential open network participant.

## Divergence

In finance, divergence occurs when an asset’s market price is moving in the opposite direction of another piece of data, usually represented by a technical analysis indicator. Divergences are used by traders and investors in an attempt to determine if a market trend is getting weaker, which may lead to a consolidation period or a trend reversal.

Trading volume is one simple example of an indicator that can produce divergences. In this case, the market price will create a divergence when moving in a direction that goes against the trading volume. For instance, if an asset’s price is moving up with a decreasing trading volume, one could consider this to be a divergence.

## Diversification

In the context of financial markets, diversification refers to allocating capital to different financial instruments within and across asset classes. The main goal is to reduce the overall risks that may arise from holding a single asset class, such as a stock, bond, commodity, or cryptocurrency.

The idea behind the diversification strategy is that a portfolio made of a wide variety of assets is more likely to give better long-term returns, while also reducing the probability of significant losses. Diversification can be achieved within a single asset class (e.g., investing in different types of cryptocurrencies) or across various asset classes (e.g., investing in cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities).

## Do Your Own Research (DYOR)

DYOR stands for Do Your Own Research and is a common phrase used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, the acronym is not a piece of advice exclusive to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It is commonly used throughout the internet due to how fast and easily misinformation can spread.

#### DYOR in DeFi

DYOR aims to reduce the number of uninformed investors in cryptocurrency. It encourages them to research and understand a cryptocurrency before investing so that they can answer precisely why they are buying that currency and supporting that project.

The term is also often used as a disclaimer when cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts make public posts or share their market analyses on social media platforms.

## Double Spending

When a given amount of coins are spent more than once. Usually as a result of a race attack or a 51% attack.&#x20;

## E

## Eclipse Attack

When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is an economic theory stipulating that the financial markets reflect all available information on the price of assets at any given time. Initially developed by economist Eugene Fama in the ‘60s, the theory states that it is nearly impossible for investors to gain an edge over the market in the long run. Assets will be valued at their fair price, as all known information will be traded on until it ceases to be useful.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (Weak)

As a condition in EMH, **weak** implies that current prices take into account all historical data, and, consequently, that technical analysis is irrelevant. However, it omits other kinds of information and does not reject the notion that methods like fundamental analysis or extensive research can be used to gain an edge.\


## Efficient Market Hypothesis (Semi-Strong)

As a condition in EMH, The **semi-strong** form dictates that all public information has already been factored into the price (news, statements by companies, etc.). As such, proponents of this branch believe that even fundamental analysis cannot yield any advantage. The only way to gain an advantage over the market is to exploit private information, which is not yet known to the public.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (Strong)&#x20;

As a condition in EMH, the **strong** form holds that all public and private information is reflected in an asset’s price – on top of historical performance and public information, any data available to insiders, too, will be taken advantage of. This form holds that there is no conceivable way for any market participant to gain an edge with any type of information, as the market will already have taken it into account.

## Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)

The industry’s first global standards organization to deliver an open, standards-based architecture and specification to accelerate the adoption of Enterprise Ethereum.

## Epoch

In a computing context, an epoch is a date and time relative to which a computer's clock and timestamp values are determined. The epoch traditionally corresponds to 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds (00:00:00) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on a specific date, which varies from system to system. Most versions of Unix, for example, use January 1, 1970, as the epoch date; Windows uses January 1, 1601; Macintosh systems use January 1, 1904, and Digital Equipment Corporation's Virtual Memory System (VMS) uses November 17, 1858.

In Initium terminology, the epoch is the length of a certain amount of blocks (in Initium: “slots”) in which the validator schedule of Initium's consensus algorithm is defined. To stakers this means that beginning and stopping to stake, as well as reward distribution, always happen when epochs switch over.

## ERC

ERC stands for **Ethereum Request for Comments**. This isn’t a technology or platform, it provides technical guidance to developers for construction. As of December 2018, there are nine final Ethereum Requests for Comments. ERC-20, ERC-55, ERC-137, ERC-162, ERC-165, ERC-181, ERC-190, ERC-721, and ERC-1167.

Developers can create an ERC by submitting an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP).

## ERC-20

ERC-20 is a technical standard used to issue and implement tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed in November 2015 by Ethereum developer Fabian Vogelsteller. The standard describes a common set of rules that should be followed for a token to function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, ERC-20 should not be considered a piece of code or software. Instead, it may be described as a technical guideline or specification. The ERC-20 standard makes it easier for developers to predict with more accuracy the interaction between different tokens and applications. It also defines how ERC-20 tokens are transferred within the Ethereum blockchain and how their respective supply and address balances are being consistently recorded.

Technically, the ERC-20 standard describes six functions that maintain some functionalities and features of Ethereum-based digital tokens. These functions include the way tokens are transferred between addresses and some important data related to the token smart contract, such as symbol, name, and supply.

## ERC-721

\
ERC-721 tokens differ from ERC-20 tokens in the sense that ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible. This means that each token is unique and as a result, not interchangeable.

ERC-721 - The Non-Fungible Token Standard, was created by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs due to ERC-20 interface incapabilities. Through an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) created on the 24th of January 2018. A popular Ethereum decentralized application, Cryptokitties, utilized ERC-721 to create unique digital collectibles in the form of kitties.\
Each different kitten was worth a different amount on the marketplace, dictated by the users of the platform. Each different kitten commands a different price, and as a result, each token needs to be unique.&#x20;

The creation of blockchain-based non-fungible tokens allows for:

* physical property (houses, artwork, and vehicles)
* Virtual Collectibles (Cryptokitties, rare pepes, collectible cards)
* Assets with negative value (loans)

In order to create an ERC-721 token, the contract must be compliant with both the ERC-721 and ERC-165 interfaces.&#x20;

## ERX-1155

This standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require the deployment of separate contracts per token type. The ERC-721 standard’s token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the [ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply, and other attributes.&#x20;

## Exchange

An exchange is an organized marketplace in which financial instruments – such as cryptocurrencies, commodities, and securities – are traded. An exchange may operate on a real-world facility or on a digital platform. Many traditional exchanges, which were initially restricted to physical trading, are now providing digitized services as a way to enable electronic trading (also known as paperless trading).\


## Fakeout

A fakeout is a term used in technical analysis (TA) that refers to a situation where a trader enters a position expecting a price movement that ultimately doesn’t happen. In fact, in most cases, a fakeout is used to refer to a situation where the price goes in the opposite direction of the trade idea or signal.&#x20;

## Falling Knife

The term falling knife (also known as "Catching a Falling Knife" or "Catching the Bottoms") refers to the action of buying an asset that is rapidly declining in price.

## Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

FOMO is the acronym for “Fear Of Missing Out.” The concept was first described in 2000 by Dr. Dan Herman in an academic paper entitled “The Journal of Brand Management.” However, the acronym FOMO was coined a couple of years later by Patrick McGinnis in an opinion piece published in 2004 in the American magazine “The Harbus.”

The concept refers to the feeling of anxiety or the idea that other people are sharing in a positive or unique experience while you are missing out. It is a phenomenon that is quite prevalent in social media, with the feeds from others often highlighting and emphasizing the positive and rewarding parts of their lives, leading the reader to feel sad or inadequate with their own experiences.

## Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)

The traditional meaning of FUD relates to a malicious marketing strategy that involves the dissemination of negative information about the competitors of a particular company, with the final goal to undermine their credibility. The idea is to invite unfavorable opinions and speculation about the products or services of competing businesses so that customers lose confidence in them.

## Fair Launch&#x20;

A concept where a Developer decides to not seek outside investment and also does not hold back a share of a coin or token's launch for themselves or others. This is considered to be much fairer to early investors as their share of equity or ownership of a coin or token is not diluted by pre-investors or founders/founding teams.

## Fair Launch Coin/Token&#x20;

A Fair Launch coin or token is characterized by a launch that is fair to the public. This means that there was no Founder, Foundation or Development Team, Venture Capitalist, or early investor pre-allocation or pre-mining program to privately claim a portion of a coin's supply before its release for sale to the public. The first Fair Launch token was YFI, which was launched in 2020 by Developer Andre Cronje.

## Fiat

A currency that has been established as a valid form of money is typically supported by a government regulation that declares it to be legal tender. The term fiat comes from  Latin and is a word used to describe a government decree, order, or resolution. By definition, fiat money is a currency that does not have any intrinsic value as it is not backed by a physical commodity and is usually made of a worthless or low-value material (such as a small piece of paper). Even so, fiat money is widely accepted as a means of payment.

## Fill Or Kill Order (FOK)

Some exchanges and trading platforms offer a type of order known as “Fill or Kill Order” (FOK). The term refers to the idea that an order must be filled immediately in its entirety or not executed at all. It is closely related to the “All or Nothing” (AON) order type, which refers to an order that must be filled in its entirety or not at all. Unlike, FOK orders, however, AON orders don’t have a specific focus on the immediate point in time.

## Finality

Finality is the assurance or the guarantee that cryptocurrency transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed. The latency level of a blockchain will ultimately affect the chain's finality rate.

## First-Mover Advantage (FMA)

The first-mover advantage refers to the competitive advantage of the first project to bring a service or product into a new and unexplored market or industry. By virtue of being the first to launch, there is an uncontested opportunity to establish brand recognition, market share, and consumer loyalty before other businesses and products eventually enter the space as competitors.

Such an advantage is notably important in the cryptocurrency industry, as blockchain-based projects and cryptocurrency exchanges compete for the relatively limited market share and user base. Because these companies and their networks are directly dependent on their visibility and reputation, capturing a large user base at early stages can make for a significant lead.&#x20;

## Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy is a term used to describe how authorities adjust the tax rates and spending levels of a country. It allows them to monitor and ultimately influence the economy of a nation by defining how public funds are collected and used.\
\


## Financial Primitive

A cryptocurrency-based financial generic building block. Financial Primitives are designed to efficiently and reliably perform one task. Financial Primitives may be combined to create smart contracts. These smart contracts may even be stacked upon one another to implement financial trading strategies.

## Flash Loan

A type of loan that is only possible in the world of cryptocurrencies. A Flash Loan is a type of loan where the asset, often Ethereum or an ERC-20 coin, is loaned out only for the duration of the length of time it takes to complete one transaction block on the blockchain. As long as the loan is paid back before the next transaction block begins there is no interest fee incurred by the borrower.

Flash Loans allow for new types of investments that are nearly instantaneous algorithmic scripts to run in Smart Contracts that can be stacked upon one another for innovative yet sometimes risky investments. Flash Loans may also have vulnerabilities that may include systems vulnerabilities that take advantage of approved existing systems but are used in a novel malicious manner.



## Flippening&#x20;

The term Flippening was colloquially coined in 2017 and refers to the possibility of the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) overtaking the market capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC). Therefore, the term describes the hypothetical moment in the future when Ethereum becomes the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

## Forced Liquidation

Forced liquidation refers to an involuntary conversion of assets into cash or cash equivalents (such as stable coins). It is a mechanism that creates market orders to exit leveraged positions. The term liquidation simply means selling assets for cash. Forced liquidation means that this selling happens automatically when certain conditions are met. In the context of cryptocurrencies, forced liquidation happens when the investor or trader is unable to fulfill the margin requirements for a leveraged position. The concept of liquidation applies to both futures and margin trading.

## Full Node

A computer that fully implements the entirety of rules of an underlying blockchain network and completely validates transactions and blocks on a blockchain.

## Fundamental Analysis (FA)

Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method used by investors and traders in financial markets to assess the intrinsic value of an asset or business by examining as many qualitative and quantitative factors as possible, such as company management and reputation, industry health, and market capitalization, and other economic factors. The goal of fundamental analysis is to determine whether or not the price of an asset is overvalued or undervalued.

Fundamental analysis works on the understanding that the future potential of an asset should be based on more than just prior performance. It takes into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions that may have an effect on that particular market.

## Fungibility

An asset is considered fungible when its units are interchangeable with one another, meaning they are indistinguishable. In other words, an asset class is fungible when each unit of the asset has the same validity and market value. For example, a pound of pure gold is equal to any other pound of pure gold, regardless of the shape. Other examples of fungible asset classes may include commodities, fiat currencies, bonds, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies.\


## Future Contracts

Futures contracts often referred to as futures, are agreements that bind traders to buy or sell assets in the future at a specific price and date. These financial instruments are frequently used by both hedgers and speculators as a way to potentially anticipate future price movements, either for hedging against risks or for making profits.&#x20;

A futures contract specifies the number of units of an asset that will be bought or sold, as well as the price and the time at which the asset will “change hands.” Settlement of the contract occurs when it reaches its expiration date, at which point whoever holds the futures is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset for the agreed-upon price.

## G

## Gas

The term gas refers to the pricing mechanism used on the Ethereum network. Such a mechanism calculates the costs (fees) for performing a transaction or executing a smart contract operation. While ether (ETH) is the currency that fuels the Ethereum network, Gas is a special unit that is used to measure how much ”work” (computational resources) certain task requires. Naturally, demanding tasks will have a higher gas cost than other operations that require less computational resources.

Note that fees are still paid in ether (ETH), but gas and ETH are two different things. Simply put, computational tasks are measured in terms of “gas cost”. On the other hand, each unit of gas has a “gas price” that is defined in ether (ETH). As such, every transaction has a particular “gas price” for each unit of gas.&#x20;

## Gas Fee

Gas fees are rewards paid to Proof Of Work miners to incentivize them to support the network's transactions which become written to the blockchain. In Ethereum, this gas fee unit amount is expressed in Gwei. Withdrawals or transfers to or from CEXs, DEXs Liquidity Pools, and Wallets all incur a gas fee. The amount of this gas fee will vary in cost depending on supply and demand. As currently designed: when demand on Ethereum or an ERC-20 network is at its highest, gas fees are at also their highest.\


## Gas Limit

The term gas limit refers to the maximum price a cryptocurrency user is willing to pay when sending a transaction, or performing a smart contract function, in the Ethereum blockchain. These fees are calculated in the gas unit, and the gas limit defines the maximum value that the transaction or function can "charge" or take from the user. As such, the gas limit works as a security mechanism that prevents high fees from being incorrectly charged due to a bug or error in a smart contract.

## General Public License&#x20;

GPL, or General Public License (GPL), refers to a free, copyleft license for the software. It grants anyone the right to freely use, read, copy, share, modify, and distribute a computer program or other kinds of work. GPL was originally written for the GNU Project and was the first copyleft license to be adopted for general use. It was created in early 1989 by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

## Genesis Block

The genesis block is the first-ever block recorded on its respective blockchain network, also occasionally referred to as Block 0 or Block 1.

When a block is broadcasted to the blockchain, it references the previous block. However, in the case of the genesis block, there is no previous block to reference.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/Initium-Labs) is a web-based open source development platform and hosting service that allows users to upload files, documents, and computer code to their accounts. GitHub allows both registered and non-registered users to view, download, and even contribute to the uploaded files and source code repositories. Due to its low cost and features, GitHub became the largest source code platform in the world, being used by many developers as a way to perform collaborative work, while also being able to share a variety of software, files, and documentation.

## Governance

Governance refers to the control and use of a Governance coin, token, and/or project through various measures to grow the ecosystem or product and to maximize gains for governance token holders.

## Governance Token&#x20;

A token is used to govern the operations and influence the direction of a coin, token, and/or project controlled by the Governance Token. Holding these tokens is often profitable through direct price appreciation of popular governance tokens, but may come with other benefits that are only available to governance token holders and voters. Examples of governance tokens are MKR and YFI.

## Gwei

The term Gwei refers to a small denomination of ether (ETH), which is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Gwei is a unit of measurement of gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum network or ERC-20 coin networks.

## H

## Halving

In the cryptocurrency space, the term halving refers to a process that reduces the issuance rate of new coins. More precisely, halving is the periodical reduction of the block subsidy provided to miners. The halving ensures that a crypto asset will follow a steady issuance rate until its maximum supply is eventually reached.

## Hard Cap

For an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the term hard cap refers to the upper limit on the number of tokens that can be sold. It relates to the maximum amount of funds the development team is willing to collect in exchange for their tokens during that early stage of funding.&#x20;

## Hash

In cryptography, the word hash refers to the output produced by a hash function after a piece of data is submitted (mapped) through it. Other than simply hash, the output produced by hash functions may also be referred to as hash value, hash code, or digest. \


## Hash Rate

The term hash rate refers to the speed at which a computer is able to perform hashing computations. In the context of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the hash rate represents the efficiency and performance of a mining machine. It defines how fast mining hardware operates when trying to compute a valid block hash.\


## Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC)

The term Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC) refers to a special feature that is used to create smart contracts that are able to modify payment channels. Technically, the HTLC feature enables the implementation of time-bound transactions between two users. In practice, the recipient of an HTLC transaction has to acknowledge the payment by submitting a cryptographic proof within a specified timeframe (number of blocks). If the recipient forfeits or fails to claim the payment, the funds will be returned to the original sender.

## HODL

HODL is a term commonly used by cryptocurrency investors that refuse to sell their cryptocurrency regardless of the price increasing or decreasing. It is more frequently used during a bear market when people refuse to sell their coins despite the price drop. \


## HODLer

One who HODLs.

## Honeypot&#x20;

A mechanism used in computer security is used to detect or counteract unauthorized access to information systems.

## I

## Iceberg Order

A conditional order to buy or sell a large portion of assets in smaller predetermined quantities in order to conceal the total order quantity.

## Immutability

Immutability is one of the key features of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Immutable transactions make it impossible for any entity (for example, a government or corporation) to manipulate, replace, or falsify data stored on the network.&#x20;

## Impermanent Loss

In Automated Market Makers (AMM) lending providers (LPs) contribute assets for liquidity to market participants. These AMM pools utilize a bonding curve, typically built on a constant function market marker formula. Asset prices are constantly changed by the AMM pool in response to trading activities by participants. This is an effort to ensure that LPs can receive the same amount of assets they deposited when they withdrew.

However, due to the volatility of asset prices and arbitragers, LPs occasionally will not receive the exact amount of assets upon withdrawal. The dollar value of the assets they withdraw would typically be lower than if they had no provided liquidity and just held the assets. This dollar value shortfall is known as impermanent loss. The loss is said to be impermanent because if asset prices return to the level during withdrawal the loss is eliminated.

## Index

Within financial markets, indexes are often based on a list of various stock quotes and are commonly used to track the performance of the stock market, through a statistical measure of changes - acting as a small sample that represents a bigger portion of the stock market as a whole. Each index follows a particular set of rules and calculation methodology, but ideally, the value variation of an index should reflect an exactly proportional change in the stocks. Therefore, a 5% change in a certain index should represent a 5% change, on average, in all stock markets that are being considered in the calculation.

## Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is an innovative approach for raising funds through the use of digital currencies (cryptocurrencies). Such a strategy is more prevalent in cryptocurrency projects that are yet to fully developed their blockchain-based product, service, or platform. The funds collected on ICO events are normally received as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), but in some cases, fiat currency may also be taken as payment.

## Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)

An Initial Exchange Offering, commonly referred to as an IEO, is a fundraising event that is administered by an exchange. In contrast to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where the project team themselves conduct the fundraising, an Initial Exchange Offering means that the fundraising will be conducted on a well-known exchange’s fundraising platform, where users can purchase tokens with funds directly from their own exchange wallet.&#x20;

## Interoperability

A concept of allowing blockchains to be compatible with each other and build upon each other's features and use-cases.

## K

## Know Your Customer (KYC)

KYC refers to a process that banks and other financial institutions use to gather identifying data and contact information from current and potential customers. Its purpose is to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activity, as well as the misuse of financial accounts.

In the US, Banks are legally mandated to use KYC in compliance with the 2001 USA Patriot Act. In 1989, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to fight money laundering on an international scale. FAFT sets standards and provides recommendations to accomplish this goal through Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices. Member countries and jurisdictions enforce various laws, rules, and regulations to work with the AML guidelines. KYC and AML go hand-in-hand in helping to prevent dishonest and criminal financial activity.

## L

## Latency

Latency in computing refers to the time delay between an input and the received output. It is inherent at all levels of computing, from the IO latency between the user and the computer to the network latency as data and information travel from a computer to servers around the world. In cryptocurrencies, latency can refer to two different time delays. The first is the latency in the network of a blockchain, and the second is the latency on an exchange.&#x20;

## Law of Demand

Demand can be described as the preparedness of consumers to buy a specific amount of assets, goods, or services for a particular price. So, the main elements of demand include, among other factors, the price of the goods, and the consumers’ preferences.

We may assume that the quantity of customers who are willing to purchase a given amount of goods depends on a number of variables. In this case, one of the most important variables is the asset price.

The aspect of demand and supply echoes from that perspective. The law of demand states that as the price of commodities increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and as the price declines the quantity demanded increases.

In other words, the law of demand is perceived to occur in the following circumstances: as the price of an asset or good increases, consumers will opt to buy less. But, if the price declines, they will be naturally inclined to purchase more of the same exact product.

When analyzing the law of demand, there is a demand schedule. It represents a series of quantities that consumers would like to purchase per unit at different prices. There are two situations in-demand schedule, which include individual demand schedule, and market demand schedule. The individual demand schedule shows the quantities of a given good which an individual buyer is ready to buy at different costs at a given time. The market demand schedule describes the quantities of a specific good that all customers will buy at the indicated market price at a given period of time.

In conclusion, the law of demand demonstrates the association between quantity demanded and the price of an asset. Most consumers prefer to purchase commodities when the prices are low. It is important to note that a thorough understanding of the law of demand can be used to predict certain economic events. For instance, a reduction in the demand for housing is usually a sign the economy is weakening.&#x20;

## Layer 2

Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. The main goal of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling difficulties that are being faced by the major cryptocurrency networks.

## Ledger

A ledger may be defined as either a physical book or a digital computer file where monetary and financial transactions are noted down and recorded - either in the form of debits or in the form of credits. Usually, ledgers also include the balance for each individual or account that is part of that particular set of economic records, along with the date of each financial transaction.

While physical ledgers are getting less popular, digital ones are being extensively used worldwide, in many different scenarios. For instance, a company or business may use a digital ledger to keep track of its financial transactions. Ledgers may be used for tracking sales, purchases, or simply the exchange of funds between employees (or between different companies). When it comes to digital environments, blockchains can be considered a prominent and highly efficient example of a digital ledger because it works as an immutable database. Typically, blockchains are used to track all transactions that take place between cryptocurrency users. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain acts as a digital ledger that stores all Bitcoin transactions inside blocks that are linked through cryptographic proofs. The linked blocks form a long chain of blocks (hence, the term blockchain). After transactions are added to these blocks and blocks are confirmed, it is almost impossible for these transactions to be reversed, and this is what makes blockchain so secure and useful.

## Lending Aggregator

A program or a series of smart contracts that automatically seeks the best lending rates for depositors loaning coins for returns on their investment or ROI.

## Lending Provider

A Lending Provider is a person or group who provides cryptocurrency capital in exchange for a share of rewards and fees gained by lending out and providing liquidity for various cryptocurrency coins and their respective networks. Loans are provided to traders, investors, exchanges, cryptocurrency networks, DAOs, and CIIs to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities and business opportunities by actors within the CeFi and DeFi space.

## Leverage

The use of multipliers on exchanges or markets that allow leveraged trading, such that providing 1 BTC deposit on such an exchange could provide the investment power of 10 to 100 BTC if used at 10x to 100x leverage.

Leveraged trades can amplify gains greatly. However, should the trade be unprofitable, it can also amplify losses greatly. The downside of this risky approach is that the entire deposit, 1 BTC in this example, could be lost in a liquidation event where a margin call on this leveraged trade could result in the entire deposit being lost during times of massive volatility and insufficient reserve funds for the investor, trader, or CII.

## Liquidation Event

Another term for a Forced Liquidation, is where due to rapid market changes, or a change in prevailing market sentiment, a trader or investor is unable to meet a margin call on their leveraged investment, their trading position is eliminated or liquidated, and the investor loses all or part of their initial investment(s).

## Liquidity

A measure of how much available circulating supply there is of an asset or currency, and the activity of that asset or currency in exchange, economy, or network. A currency with low supply and/or circulation is said to be illiquid.

## Liquidity Mining

An energy-efficient form of cryptocurrency mining that supports work and transactions on a blockchain usually without expensive application or hardware-specific equipment required by older forms of cryptocurrency mining.

Rewards are provided to liquidity providers as a means to incentivize liquidity mining providers, in addition to growing and supporting a blockchain's user base.

## Liquidity Pool

An LP, or Liquidity Pool, is a pool of deposited funds meant to provide liquidity to a currency, network, or Smart Contract. Liquidity is considered the lifeblood of any physical or digital currency, exchange, or financial network, so there will be designed rewards or incentives given to those who provide liquidity to LPs.

## Liquidity Providers

In the realm of cryptocurrency and DeFi, this refers to investors who deposit an asset to provide liquidity on an exchange and/or network(s) to gain an ROI on their investment. Investors deposit one or more of their digital assets into decentralized Liquidity Pools (LPs) to provide liquid capital to exchanges and smart contracts. Liquidity Providers often provide two or more types of assets, in which Impermanent Loss is sometimes seen.

## Liquidity Token

Implemented via Smart Contracts, a liquidity token is given to a depositor in exchange for that investor's deposit(s) to be used for other purposes such as yield farming. Examples of liquidity tokens include aDAI, yCRV, and yYFI. A liquidity token can be exchanged back.

## Listing

When an exchange offers trading pairs for a particular asset, this action is known as “listing” the asset. In traditional markets, this means that a company's shares (or material assets) are available to be traded on that particular stock exchange. In general, this means that the company listed has passed certain thresholds for financial and regulatory viability in addition to a degree of trust from the exchange. Thus, by the act of listing, the exchange is signaling that the shares of the company/asset are known to be of a base threshold of quality.

## M

## Mainnet

Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). \


## Mainnet Swap

Essentially, a mainnet swap consists of switching from one blockchain network to another. In most cases, the swap takes place when a cryptocurrency project migrates from a third-party platform (e.g., Ethereum) to its own native blockchain network. At this point, their cryptocurrency tokens are gradually replaced by newly issued coins and all blockchain activity is moved to the new chain.

## Maker

In trading, You become a “maker” when you place an order and it does not trade immediately, so your order stays in the order book and waits for someone else to fill/match with it later.

## Maker DAO

Maker DAO (a.k.a. Maker) is a decentralized governed financial ecosystem based on a Stablecoin called DAI. DAI is algorithmically pegged to $1 USD, with no volatility. A digital asset with no volatility at all is sometimes seen as a hedge or safety measure in times of high volatility or during Bear markets.

## Maker DAO CPT

The MakerDAO Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is a smart contract which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a core component of the Sai Stablecoin System whose purpose is to create Sai in exchange for collateral which it then holds in escrow until the borrowed Sai is returned.

## Margin

An available avenue of borrowed capital that is considered very high risk, as collateral must be provided for a margin loan to secure the loan. It is called the margin or a margin loan because a risky loan is being taken on the margins of the investment to hopefully amplify gains for the investor or trader.

A margin loan is considered very high risk as the deposited base asset is at risk of liquidation during a margin call.

## Margin Call

The act of implementing a Forced Liquidation or Liquidation Event when an investor or trader cannot meet debt obligations on leveraged trade positions. Margin calls can be triggered by rapidly changing market conditions and high volatility that bring Liquidation Events for some leveraged traders on exchanges and markets.

## Market Capitalization&#x20;

A.K.A. the Marketcap, is a measure of the total funds invested in a company or project. This market cap of a coin, company, or project can be calculated by multiplying the asset's unit price by the total number of coins.

## Market Momentum&#x20;

The term market momentum refers to the ability of a particular market to maintain a continuous increase or decrease in price within a certain timeframe. Essentially, market momentum is what creates a market trend. Since the market momentum is a result of the variations in the market price of an asset, it also reflects the current market sentiment.

## Market Order

A market order is an order to instantly buy or sell at the best available price. It is executed based on the limit orders that are already located in the order book, meaning that market orders depend on market liquidity to be completed.

## Maximum Supply

The maximum supply of a cryptocurrency refers to the maximum number of coins or tokens that will be ever created. This means that once the maximum supply is reached, there won’t be any new coins mined, minted, or produced in any other way.

## MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a popular mobile or desktop software cryptocurrency wallet that can hold, transmit or receive Ethereum and ERC-20 compatible coins or tokens. It's also compatible with various blockchain networks including BSC, Polygon, etc.&#x20;

## Mining Pool

A pool of cryptocurrency miners that provides mining services to a cryptocurrency network. Mining Pool operators and contributors are incentivized by a coin or token's programmed mining rewards to support transactions and provide liquidity on a coin's network.

## Multisig Wallet

A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Community-governed projects like a DAO often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed. For community-based efforts, Multisig wallets for DAOs and DeFi projects are often implemented as 6 of 9 wallets, where 6 of 9 community wallet signers must agree to sign a transaction before a Smart Contract can be implemented.

## N

## Node

In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a node refers to each computer running the Bitcoin client. So the Bitcoin network is made up of thousands of computer nodes spread around the world, and this is what makes Bitcoin a peer-to-peer, distributed economic system.

## Non-fungible Token (NFT)

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. NFTs are tokenized versions of digital or real-world assets. They function as verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable with each other and introduce scarcity to the digital world.

## O

## Off-Chain

Transactions that occur of a given blockchain network, maybe later reported or batched together before being submitted to the main chain.

## Oracle&#x20;

A feed of data, such as the current market prices of an asset or assets, that provides a high confidence service to users and other services that the source and detail of the oracle's data are timely, accurate, and untampered. Sources of data may be singular or decentralized sources and may be dispersed geographically from one another. All exchanges and markets require accurate and timely information to operate properly at high efficiency. An example of the most well-known oracle protocol is [Chainlink (LINK)](https://chain.link).

## P

## Pool

A smart contract containing shared amounts of assets provided by depositors. Pools are either used in Automated Market Makers (AMMs)for optimized trading purposes, lending aggregation (yPool), or in shared yield farming strategies (yVaults), among other things.

## Primitive

A generic building block.

## Protocol

In High Technology, a protocol is a set of developed rules or specifications. These rules detail definitions, standards, limitations, and potential stipulations of a protocol. Examples of technology protocols include TCP/IP and ERC-20.

## R

## Rebalance

1. To make changes to a portfolio or pool of funds for various reasons.
2. An automated or manual tactical change to a yield farming strategy that is meant to nearly instantaneously do one or more of the following actions:
   * Gain profits through arbitrage
   * Take or secure profits
   * Reduce risks to investors or pooled funds

During periods of high volatility, the latter is especially the case if margin or leveraged funding is used by the trader, investor, or controller in charge of pooled funds. If an assessment is made that market conditions are a risk to invested funds, mitigation efforts will be implemented either autonomously or through manual intervention to reduce risks to invested funds.

## Retail Investor

A non-professional individual investor who buys, sells, lends, and/or yields farms cryptocurrencies, crypto derivatives, and crypto offerings. Retail investors pay full retail price for their transactions, instead of benefitting from volume discounts and other preferential treatment reserved for whales and CIIs.

## ROI

Return On Investment. The gains or losses on an investment. For example, doubling your investment in an asset would be a 100% gain, or 100% ROI. Losing all of your investment would be a 100% loss, or -100% ROI.

## S

## Slippage

In trade, there is almost always a spread between the price that a buyer will pay and the price that a seller will sell an asset. When an order is made, this difference in price between buyer and seller expectations results in price slippage. This slippage in price is usually 1-3% but can be even more for coins with limited liquidity. This slippage can lead to a final sale price of the asset that is either more or less than the requested transaction amount.

## Smart Contract

A digital contract that is programmed in a language that is considered Turing complete, meaning that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform almost any digital task or process. Ethereum's programming languages, such as Solidity and Vyper, are Turing complete.

## Spread

When an order is made on an exchange or market, the disagreement of the difference in price between potential buy and sell offers of an asset is called the spread. A wide spread in price can lead to higher slippage.

## Stablecoin

In cryptocurrency, it is a digital cryptocurrency equivalent to one (1) Dollar USD. In theory, the price of the stablecoin is pegged to the US Dollar, but in practice, there is some variance to nearly all stablecoins except for coins like DAI, which are designed with no volatility.

A stablecoin is an attractive investment to investors because:

* It can be used as a safe harbor or hedge for cryptocurrency funds in times of downward volatility, also known as a bear market, whether this trend in downward volatility is temporary or prolonged in duration.
* It can be used as diversification into the realm of Cryptocurrency finance to take advantage of new products in CeFi and DeFi that are unavailable elsewhere, as a safe diversification into crypto that won't lose nor gain significant value to the stablecoin price.
* A coin with a stable price is used for transferring crypto around, as a means to not lose value in the base asset itself as its being moved around or deployed to Smart Contracts or wallets.

## Stake

The act of depositing a cryptocurrency coin or token into a yield farming project and/or protocol, whether the access to the project is either through CeFi or DeFi methods.

Stakers hope to gain interest on their deposits into these yield farming projects and offerings. CeFi is considered safer for several reasons - including strict rules, permitting, and regulations. However, DeFi tends to give much higher rewards, while being accompanied by much higher risks, the earlier the investor participates in the project's lifecycle, testing, and development.

## Staking

The act of staking a cryptocurrency deposit to yield farm additional cryptocurrency via CeFi or DeFi staking offerings, programs, or projects.

## T

## Testnet

A testing network for a new coin, project, or product, or for potential improvements to an existing product or offering. Testnets are used to test the viability and vulnerability of new ideas, concepts, code, and processes prior to moving on to a production network or networks of some sort.

## Token

A type of coin, except with much greater functionality. Tokens can also be used as a method of payment like coins, but unlike coins, they can excel at other use cases such as the democratic governance of a protocol or system, or as a means to use underlying coins to make liquidity tokens from these coin deposits.

These liquidity tokens could then be used in innovative new strategies elsewhere via delegated funds to amplify gains with little risk to the underlying asset the liquidity token is based upon. An investor could choose this action so that further gains to their assets may be made by using the automated actions of intelligent Smart Contracts to optimize gains.

## Turing Complete

In programming, it refers to a language that is powerful and semi-autonomous, in a way. When a language such as the Solidity or Vyper is Turing complete, it means that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract using a Turing complete language should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform nearly any digital task or process.

A Turing complete language can even be programmed to have impacts on real-world activities through electronic means, as these rapidly executed digital commands can trigger actions in the real world through sensors, relays, switches, cameras, alarms, and alerts that can trigger a human and/or automatic response.

The concept of a Turing complete programming language was named after the inventor of the idea, Alan Turing. He was an unsung war hero and legendary mathematician. Turing was also a renowned and brilliant computer scientist, cryptanalyst, and forward thinker.

## TVL

The Total Value Locked into a Smart Contract or set of Smart Contracts that may be deployed or stored at one or more exchanges or markets. This is used as a measurement of investor deposits. It is the dollar value of all the coins or tokens locked into a platform, protocol, lending program, yield farming program, or insurance liquidity pool.

## V

## Volatility

In investing, a measure of how rapid changes are seen to the price of an asset or market. Newer early-stage technology companies and projects in the explosive growth stage tend to see very high volatility in the price of their assets in their early days. Should the company or project behind the volatile asset see their venture survive over time, this volatility tends to be much reduced as the company's market cap grows and matures.

## W

## Wallet

A software or hardware cryptocurrency wallet that can hold a variety of coins.

Wallets may also be considered a cold wallet - meant to be used for long-term storage of crypto coins for security purposes or a hot wallet, which is considered more at risk than a cold wallet due to its inaccessibility (usually offline). A hot wallet is meant to be used for active or semi-active transactions in and out of that wallet, as well as a place to withdraw or add funds.

## Whale

A person who HODLs a large amount of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies.

## Wrapped Ether (WETH)

Wrapped Ether (WETH) refers to the ERC-20 compatible version of ether (wrapping ether with other ERC standards is also possible). WETH can be created by sending ether to a smart contract where the ether is placed on hold, in turn receiving the WETH ERC-20 token at a 1:1 ratio. This WETH can afterward be sent back into the same smart contract to be “unwrapped” or redeemed back for the original ether at a 1:1 ratio.

## X

## Y

## Z

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

A zero-knowledge proof, sometimes also referred to as a ZK protocol, is a verification method that takes place between a prover and a verifier. In a zero-knowledge proof system, the prover is able to prove to the verifier that they have the knowledge of a particular piece of information (such as the solution to a mathematical equation) without revealing the information itself. These proof systems can be used by modern cryptographers to provide increased levels of privacy and security.
