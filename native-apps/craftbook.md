# CraftBook

Initium CraftBook (ICB) is a collection of on-chain programs targeting the Castor parallel runtime. These programs will be tested against Initium's implementation of Castor and Initium runtime and deployed to the Hadron network. CraftBook helps the developers to deploy their projects, assets, and crafts on the Initium protocol. A community guide for Initium CraftBook will be available on https://craftbook.wiki.&#x20;
