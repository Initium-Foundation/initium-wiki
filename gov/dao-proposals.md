# DAO Proposals

Proposals play an important role in DAOs, including the Initium Foundation. The proposals and the votes of the Initium community members set the way forward, the changes, and the way of allocations and managing the DAO funds to the Initium ecosystem, projects, etc.&#x20;

#### **Proposal Tags**

There are six general tags of DAO proposals:

* **Prime** **Proposals (#prime)**: proposals with this tag are the proposals offered by the Initium Foundation Prime Members. Such proposals can be immediately implemented after getting the required votes from the DAO.&#x20;
* **Native Proposals (#native)**: these are the proposals offered by the native platforms and projects of the Initium ecosystem. Depending on the proposal's content, they may need approval from different Initium DAOs.&#x20;
* **Community Proposals (#community)**: these are the proposals offered by the community members of the Initium ecosystem. Depending on their impact on the Initium ecosystem, these proposals may require final approval by the _Covenant DAO_.&#x20;
* **Tech Proposals (#tech)**: there are proposals regarding the technical issues of the Initium ecosystem. Such proposals first need to be approved in **Blox DAO**.&#x20;
* Initium Chapters' Proposals (#chapter): one or more Initium Chapters provide proposals to the DAOs of the Initium. Depending on the proposal's scale, a #chapter proposal may be restricted for voting by the chapter members or be open for other community members to vote.
* **Partner Proposals (#partner)**: these are the proposals offered by the platforms, institutions, and projects that have been integrated with the Initium protocol and/or supporting it. Such proposals need to be reviewed by the Initium Foundation to be eligible for voting in the pertaining DAO. &#x20;
* **Alien Proposals (#alien)**: these are the proposals offered by the organizations, platforms, and institutions out of the Initium ecosystem (e.g., a platform is running on another blockchain, an exchange, hedge fund, etc.). Such proposals need to be reviewed by the Initium Foundation to be eligible for voting in the pertaining DAO.

#### **Type of DOA proposals**

There are five types of proposals in the Initium DAO as followings:

* **Governance Proposals (#gov)**: this means the non-binding, advisory proposals to adopt certain governance provisions on the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* **Project Proposals (#prp)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on joining a project in the Initium ecosystem to become a candidate for receiving funds and support from the Initium Foundation and the partner VCs. The approved candidate(s) will be eligible for "Binding Action Proposals."
* **Binding Action Proposals (#bap)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on binding actions that will result in changes to Initium DAO's smart contracts. This can include allocating some of DAO funds to a project in the ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Change and Improvement Proposals (#cip)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on the change and improvements to the Initium code of conduct, protocol improvements, etc.&#x20;
* **Election Proposals (#elc)**: these proposals allow the community to contribute to the elections in the Initium Foundation's positions, including the Initium Chapters, Primes' election, committees' elections, etc.&#x20;

Approved DAO proposals will be stored at [Initium Foundation's GitHub](https://github.com/Initium-Foundation) for future reference.&#x20;
