# Implementation Process

The proposals that are approved in DAO votings are subject to the implementation process. As every proposal has different scope(s) and its implementation may require a different implementation schedule.&#x20;

Based on its implementation schedule, an approved proposal would be scheduled in the waitlist. During this time, the required documentation will be prepared and published to update the affected issues by the proposal. The #urgent proposals are exempted from the waitlist.&#x20;

Upon the successfully implementation of a proposal, the implementation will be announced on the DAO website, and the proposal will be archived in the Implemented Proposals repository.&#x20;
