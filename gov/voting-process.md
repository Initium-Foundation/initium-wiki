# Voting Process

As mentioned in the [Draft Processing](draft-processing.md), the voting on Initium DAOs is subject to Voting Terms.&#x20;

The voting model in Initium Governance varies between Pre-Genesis and Post-Genesis eras as discussed below.&#x20;

### Pre-Genesis Voting Model

Since the majority of $INIX tokens during the Pre-Genesis era are subject to vesting time, the governance issues will be limited to the community-oriented issues Initium VVenturesC decisions. Initium Foundation will raise the primary principle for voting by the community. In this period, due to the locking of the majority of the $INIX tokens, the stakeholders will receive voting tokens, called "INIX Vote Token" ($vINIX), based on their staking.&#x20;

The owners of unlocked $INIX tokens need to stake their $INIX tokens to min $vINIX tokens for participating in DAOs. The minting of $vINIX will be done using RedWrap by a 1:1 ratio. The users can burn their $vINIX tokens to re-mint their $INIX tokens. The HODLers of Seed Funding Sales, Private Investors Sales, Validators Staking Sales, Initium Foundation, and Team allocations whose tokens are subject to a vesting period will receive an equal amount of $vINIX tokens to their $INIX tokens.&#x20;

The HODLers of $INIX tokens subject to the Public Sales Options A and B can participate in voting by minting $vINIX using RedWrap upon the termination of their vesting period. During this period, they can vote using the Transparency portal, which represents their votes based on their $INIX holdings. The Transparency votes will be added to the related DAO votes for final results.

### Post-Genesis Voting Model

By the Genesis Event, the voting model in the Initium governance will change. The Initium DAOs use a token-based quorum model for vote casting. To prevent any manipulation in the voting process, the Initium Foundation will implement DAO-oriented tokens. Every DAO has its dedicated Voting Token, pegged at a 1:1 ratio to INIX. Therefore, if any community member wants to cast his vote in a given DAO, he needs to convert his INIX tokens to that DAO token.&#x20;

This model has many advantages, including:

* Prevents vote manipulation by owners of large amounts of INIX.&#x20;
* Provides incentives for honest voting.&#x20;
* Enables the owners of smaller quantities of $INIX to cast their votes.&#x20;
* Rewards the community members based on their contributions to the DAOs.

These voting tokens are:

* **$BLOX**: the voting token used in Blox DAO.&#x20;
* **$VEND**: the voting token used in Ventures DAO.&#x20;
* **$CONT**: the voting token used in Covenant DAO.&#x20;
* **$COLE**: the voting token used in Collectio DAO.&#x20;

INIX holders can convert their $INIX tokens to their desired DAO tokens and vice versa using RedWrap.&#x20;

### The Trust Period

Every proposal is subject to a given voting schedule in the proposal manifest. By finishing the voting schedule, the DAO tokens used for casting the votes will be locked for at least 48 hours. This period is called the Trust Period and is considered to avoid spam votes. By finishing the trust period, the voting tokens are unlocked. Some proposals are subject to Voting Rewards. In such cases, the rewards also will be distributed to the voters after the Trust Period. In the case of #urgent tagged proposals, this period can be minimized by the Initium Foundation.

### Result Announcement&#x20;

By end of the Trust Period, the voting results will be announced by the Initium Foundation on the DAO website.&#x20;

### Revoting&#x20;

Revoting only applies to the proposals that could not reach the voting threshold. In such a case, the revoting is available only once for a proposal.&#x20;
