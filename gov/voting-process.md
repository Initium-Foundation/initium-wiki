# Voting Process

As mentioned in the [Draft Processing](draft-processing.md), the voting on Initium DAOs is subject to Voting Terms.&#x20;

### The Voting Model

The Initium DAOs use a token-based quorum model for vote casting. To prevent any manipulation in the voting process, the Initium Foundation will implement DAO-oriented tokens. Every DAO has its dedicated Voting Token, pegged at a 1:1 ratio to INIX. Therefore, if any community member wants to cast his vote in a give DAO, needs to convert his INIX tokens to that DAO token.&#x20;

This model has many advantages, including:

* Prevents vote manipulation by owners of large amounts of INIX.&#x20;
* Provides incentives for honest voting.&#x20;
* Enables the owners of smaller amounts of INIX to contribute actively to the voting.&#x20;
* Rewards the community members based on their contributions to the DAOs.

These tokens are:

* **$BLOX**: refers to the voting token that is used in Blox DAO.&#x20;
* **$DENA**: refers to the voting token that is used in Denarius DAO.&#x20;
* **$CONT**: refers to the voting token that is used in Covenant DAO.&#x20;
* **#COLE**: refers to the voting token that is used in Collectio DAO.&#x20;

INIX holders can convert their INIX tokens to their desired DAO tokens and vice versa using RedWap.&#x20;

### The Trust Period

Every proposal is subject to a given voting schedule in the proposal manifest. By finishing the voting schedule, the DAO tokens used for casting the votes will be locked for at least 48 hours. This period is called the Trust Period and is considered to avoid spam votes. By finishing the trust period, the voting tokens are unlocked. Some proposals are subject to Voting Rewards. In such cases, the rewards also will be distributed to the voters after the Trust Period. In the case of #urgent tagged proposals, this period can be minimized by the Initium Foundation.

### Result Announcement&#x20;

By end of the Trust Period, the voting results will be announced by the Initium Foundation on the DAO website.&#x20;

### Revoting&#x20;

Revoting only applies to the proposals that could not reach the voting threshold. In such a case, the revoting is available only once for a proposal.&#x20;
