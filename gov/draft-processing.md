# Draft Processing

Every new proposal in Initium DOAs is first considered a Draft. Depening on the proposal tag and scope, A draft needs to be submitted by the proposing party to one of the Initium Native Organizations.&#x20;

To unify the proposal drafting, Initium Foundation has proposed Proposal Draft Templates (PDTs), which are accessible on the Initium DAOs website. Initium community members can also propose new PDTs via the DOA mechanism.&#x20;

The Draft processing process will take place by following steps:

**Step 1:  Draft Submission**

The Draft needs to be submitted via Initium DAO website under _Submit New Proposal_ menu. The instructions about accepted file formats are available on this page.&#x20;

**Step 2: Drat Review**

The responsible body will review the submitted Draft in the rated Initium native organization. If the Draft meets the requirements, aligns with the Initium's mission, ecosystem, and community interests, and is not against the Constitution, it will be approved. Otherwise, the Draft will be returned to the proposing party by providing the reasons and instructions for revising the proposals. This step will continue as long as the Draft meets the requirements and considerations.

**Step 3: Setting the Voting Terms**&#x20;

Upon a Draft is approved by Step 2, Initium Foundation will set its voting terms. The voting terms are:

* **Voting Scope**: depending on the scope of a given proposal, voting scope determined which members are allowed to cast their votes (e.g., Blox members or all community members).
* **Voting Schedule**: every proposal is subject to a voting schedule allowing vote casting.
* **Voting Threshold**: every proposal is subjected to a voting threshold which is the minimum share of the primary vote that a proposal requires to achieve to be a legit proposal. The voting threshold represents the contribution of voters in the voting scope. For example, if a proposal is subject to Blox Dao with 100,000 voting rights, it may need to achieve a 10% voting threshold (10,000 votes) to consider its voting valid. If a proposal cannot reach the voting threshold, the voting is not valid, and the proposal may require revoting.&#x20;
* **Approval Rate**: **** refers to the rate of For votes required for a given proposal to be approved. This rate is 51% by default, but some proposals may require more rates.&#x20;
* **Voting Right**: it refers to the minimum INIX holdings required for voting. In some proposals, the vote casting may be restricted to the voters that hold a specific amount of INIX.&#x20;
* **Implementation Schedule**: Every proposal has a timeframe to implement in the Initium ecosystem. This timeframe can be a given block height or a given calendar date/time by which the proposal will be effectively implemented. If a proposal is subject to #urgent tag, it will be implemented urgently.
* **Trust Period**: refers to the period during which the voting tokens will be locked to avoid spam votes.&#x20;
* **Voting Rewards**: some proposals are subject to voting rewards. The voting rewards of a given proposal will be distributed among the voters based on their casted votes.&#x20;

**Step 4: Proposal Announcement**

After setting the voting terms, Initium Foundation will announce the proposal on the DAO website, and the Initium community can access it. The proposal will be announced on Initium Foundation social media.
