# What is a Wallet?

A crypto wallet is a device or application that stores a collection of keys and can be used to send, receive, and track ownership of cryptocurrencies. Wallets can take many forms. A wallet might be a directory or file in your computer's file system, a piece of paper, or a specialized device called a _hardware wallet_. Various smartphone apps and computer programs also provide a user-friendly way to create and manage wallets.

### What is the Keypair?

A _keypair_ is a securely generated _private key_ and its cryptographically-derived _public key_. A private key and its corresponding public key are together known as a _keypair_. A wallet contains a collection of one or more keypairs and provides some means to interact with them.

### What is the Public Key?

The _public key_ (commonly shortened to _pubkey_) is the wallet's _receiving address_ or simply its _address_. The wallet address **may be shared and displayed freely**. When another party is going to send some amount of cryptocurrency to a given wallet, they need to know the wallet's receiving address. Depending on a blockchain's implementation, the address can also be used to view specific information about a wallet, such as viewing the balance. Still, it cannot change anything about the wallet or withdraw any tokens.

### What is the Private Key?

The _private key_ is required to digitally sign any transactions to send cryptocurrencies to another address or make any wallet changes. The private key **must never be shared**. If someone gains access to the private key to a wallet, they can withdraw all the tokens it contains. If a wallet's private key is lost, any tokens sent to that wallet's address are **permanently lost**.

Different wallet solutions offer different approaches to keypair security, interacting with the keypair, and signing transactions to use/spend the tokens. Some are easier to use than others. Some store and back up private keys more securely.&#x20;

### Does INITIUM have its dedicated wallet?

Since the mainnet of the Initium blockchain has not yet been launched, the INITIUM (official token of the Initium blockchain) is hosted on some partner blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Chain, Polygone, etc. After the successful launch of the Initium blockchain, these tokens will be replaced with the INITIUM coin.&#x20;

This is important to note that the circulating supply of INITIUM on various blockchains will be always equal to the total circulating supply of INITIUM on the market and won't exceed it. This function is controlled by `mint` and `burn` functions on the INITIUM smart contracts.&#x20;
