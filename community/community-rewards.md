# Community Rewards

To encourage the Initiumers for their support and contribution to the Initium ecosystem and projects, the Initium Foundation conducts various rewards programs under the Community Rewards topic.&#x20;

These rewards are funded by the Initium Foundations Reserves, which is a part of the total circulating supply of the INITIUM (INI) token generated during the Initial Supply TGE. In addition, the Initium Foundation will receive 10% of the _Inflation Rat_e of the INI based on the [Inflation Schedule](../crypto-economics/inflation-schedule.md).&#x20;

Initium Foundation may consider the rewards in other tokens (e.g., tokens of the projects in the Initium ecosystem) to diversify the rewards.&#x20;

Initiumers can join the [initium-premium.md](../about-initium/initium-premium.md "mention") program for greater contribution to the Initium ecosystem and benefit from the exclusive benefits considered for this program.&#x20;

Community rewards will be considered for the Initiumers who actively show their support and contribute to the Initium ecosystem in various ways, including:

* Social media activities
* Content making&#x20;
* Contributions to the Initium projects
* Community management activities
* Improvement proposals
* Graphics and publications
* Contributions to the Initiumer events
* Contributions to the Initium marketing compaign &#x20;
* Additional areas to be announced by the Initium Foundation&#x20;

### How can I know I am eligible to receive community rewards?

You'll be rewarded based on the program if you are already a contributor to Initium Premium. However, if you're new to the Initium community, you need to get further information and instructions by emailing community@initium.foundation. The Initium Foundation will review your contribution and support to the Initium. If the activities are eligible to receive the rewards, you will be informed by email, and rewards will be settled in your Wallet.

In the future, the Initium Foundation will use an automated system for tracking and evaluating the Initiumers' contributions to the ecosystem.
