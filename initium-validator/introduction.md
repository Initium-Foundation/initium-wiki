# Introduction

Validators form the backbone of the Initium network. By processing transactions and participating in consensus, each validator helps make Initium the most high-performance blockchain network in the world.

Anyone can run a validator, however, there are some requirements for being a validator.&#x20;

Validators can earn INITIUM for helping secure the Initium network. It follows the Initium economics, and validators will receive staking rewards. Validators also help increase censorship resistance on the network by increasing decentralization.
