# Validators Community

Managed by the Initium Foundation and supported by Blox, the Initium Validators Community (_IVC_) provides a series of services to the validators, including advisory services for profitability, cost-effectiveness, and technical support.&#x20;

### Initium Licensed Validators

Joining the Initium as a validator is open to everyone who meets the [validator requirements](validator-requirements.md). However, the validators who have participated in Validators' Staking Sales are eligible to receive the Initium Licensed Validator (ILV) badge in the IVC. The Initium Foundation will promote these validators to the Initium community for INIX staking.&#x20;
