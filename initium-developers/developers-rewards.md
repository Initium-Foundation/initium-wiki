# Developers Rewards

IInitium Foundation believes that the ecosystem's success lies in the seamless and continuous development of the protocol and its projects and the support and contribution of both Initiumers and developers.

Developers play essential roles in the ecosystem's success as they maintain the protocol, projects, and platforms performant. In addition to the rewards considered in the [Initium Premium](../about-initium/initium-premium.md) program, Initium Foundation will conduct various reward programs for the Initium Developers Community (Blox), including (but not limited to):

### Blox Incentives Program

This program is conducted by Initium Labs to support the Blox members who actively contribute to the development of the Initium protocol. The Blox members will receive these rewards in INIX toke.&#x20;

### Blox Awards

As an annual awarding program, the Blox Awards is a program for recognizing the best Blox members (individuals and teams) in the Initium ecosystem. Currently, the following titles have been considered for Blox Awards:

* The Developer of the Year (applies to both individuals and teams that contribute to the development of Initium protocol)
* The Project of the Year (applies to the projects that are building their applications on Initium)
* The Tutor of the Year (applies to individuals and teams that create tutorials for Initium)
* The Chapter of the Year (applies to Initium Chapters)
* The Compiler of the Year (applies to the individuals and teams that contribute to Initium documentation)&#x20;
* The Platform of the Year (applies to the projects already running on Initium)

### Seed Funding&#x20;
