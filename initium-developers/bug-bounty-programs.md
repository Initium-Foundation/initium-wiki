# Bug Bounty Programs

Initium Foundation would consider special rewards for bug bounty programs under Bug Bounty Rewards Fund (BBRF). The Initium Foundation Reserves will fund BBRF.&#x20;

Bug bounty programs on the Initium ecosystem are categorized as followings:

* **Protocol Bug Bounty Tournament:** refers to the bug bounty tournaments for debugging Initium's main codes and programs. Initium Foundation will announce each contest and the pertaining rewards.&#x20;
* **Project Bug Bounty Tournament**: refers to the bug bounty tournaments conducted by the projects developing on the Initium ecosystem. Every project will have its bug bounty rewards; however, the Initium Foundation will also consider additional incentives from BBRF for at least one bug bounty tournament per project.&#x20;

Further information about the Bug Bounty Programs is available on Initium Labs' website.&#x20;
