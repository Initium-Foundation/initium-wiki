# Introduction

Initium's crypto-economic system is designed to promote a healthy, long-term, self-sustaining economy with participant incentives aligned to the security and decentralization of the network.&#x20;

The main participants in this economy are validation clients. Their contributions to the network, state validation, and requisite incentive mechanisms are discussed in this document.&#x20;

The other participants in this crypto-economy are the HODLers. They are the users that may stake their tokens in Initium's staking pools and receive an annual percentage yield (APY). Their contribution to the network and requisite incentive mechanism are discussed in this document.&#x20;
