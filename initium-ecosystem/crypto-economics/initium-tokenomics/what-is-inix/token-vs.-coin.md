# Token vs. Coin

This document, may refer to INITIUM (INIX) as the INITIUM token, INIX token, INITIUM coin, and/or INIX coin. They all refer to INIX as the [native token](../../teminology.md#native-token) of Initium. Therefore this is useful to clarify what are the differences between the token and coin in cryptocurrency terminology.&#x20;

First of all, let's have a look at the coin and token definition.

### Coin Definition <a href="#head2" id="head2"></a>

So to understand the crypto token vs. coin difference, let’s first define what a coin is.

**A crypto coin is a crypto asset (crypto asset refers to all kinds of cryptos) that has its own blockchain** instead of running on another crypto asset’s blockchain. You could also call a crypto coin a cryptocurrency or a “native token” (confusing, we know) - the underlying idea is that the asset has its own blockchain.

The best-known example of a coin in the blockchain space is Bitcoin, the original crypto coin/cryptocurrency. Other examples include Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero.

### Token Definition <a href="#head3" id="head3"></a>

And so if a coin (otherwise known as a cryptocurrency or native token), has its own blockchain, a **token is the opposite: it runs on another blockchain**.

The best-known example is the ERC-20 token, which is any token that uses the Ethereum blockchain. The best-known ERC-20 tokens are USDT, USDC, Dai, BAT, etc.

### Token vs. Coin: The Difference <a href="#head5" id="head5"></a>

The simple explanation of the difference between coin vs. token is that a coin has its own blockchain, while a token doesn’t.

Another thing to note is that coins are usually used for one thing (payments), while tokens have various use cases, including fees and other things. For instance, when comparing a coin or cryptocurrency vs. a utility token, utility tokens are used to access a product or service.

For example, the Basic Attention Token (BAT) is used in the Brave web browser ecosystem. Advertisers pay publishers with audiences in BAT, audience members receive BAT for viewing advertisers’ ads, and audience members can use that BAT to donate to publishers or keep the BAT for themselves.

Other uses for tokens include:

* **Security tokens** - like securities from the traditional financial system (TradFi), represent shares of a company but with all the benefits of blockchain.
* **Asset tokens** - the tokens that are backed by real-world assets like gold or real estate.
* **Stablecoins** - tokens that represent more stable - at least relative to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - currencies, such as the US Dollar or Euro. Examples are USDT, BUSD, USDC, and Dai.
* **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** - NFTs represent things that are unique like art, baseball cards, and in-game items (think “virtual real estate” or unique virtual pets).
* **Governance tokens**- tokens that are used for governance of a given DAO.&#x20;
* Multipurpose tokens- the tokens that may cover various uses fees, governance, and assets together.&#x20;

### What type of token is the INIX?

INIX is defined as a multipurpose token which several functionalities including:

* **Utilities**: to be used as the means of payments within the Initium community, protocol-related platforms, and partner platforms.&#x20;
* **Governance**: to be used for voting in the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* **Staking**: to receive the staking rewards from the staking platforms.&#x20;
* **Fees**: as the native token of Initium, it will be used for paying the transaction fees on the Initium blockchain.&#x20;

### When INIX Token will be converted to INIX Coin?

By launching the mainnet of the Initium network, the owners of INIX tokens can convert them to INIX coins by a 1:1 ratio via the RedWrap. In addition, by integrating the Initium network with centralized exchanges, the owners can also convert their tokens on such platforms.

### What will happen to INITIUM Tokens if not converted?

The owners of the INIX tokens can hold their tokens as long as they want, but due to the changes to the staking programs on the Initium protocol, they no longer will be able to receive the staking rewards as such rewards will be paid to the staked INIX coins. Therefore, we strongly suggest conducting the conversion to benefit from the staking rewards.&#x20;

### What is Wrapped INIX (wINIX)?

Wrapped tokens are assets that allow the value of a native asset from one blockchain to transfer to another. One of the best-known wrapped tokens is Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). wBTC is pegged 1:1 to the price of Bitcoin (BTC) so that one wBTC should always equal one BTC.

The wrapping function enables the owners of the INIX coins to migrate their coins from the Initium blockchain to another. For example, if you have the ERC-20 version of wINIX of the Ethereum, you can easily convert it to the BEF-20 or TRC-20 version to be used on another blockchain. This function is conducted by using the RedWard platform of the Initium protocol. The wapping process will convert INIX or wINIX by a 1:1 ratio. Meanwhile, the owners of wINIX can easily unwrap it to INIX (native version of Initium blockchain).

### Why do people use wINIX?

Well, there are a vast diversity of DeFi platforms on the other blockchain ecosystems that the INIX owners may like to use them. The wrapped INIX (wINIX) enables them to migrate their INIX coins to other blockchains to benefit from available opportunities for staking, lending, trading, etc.
