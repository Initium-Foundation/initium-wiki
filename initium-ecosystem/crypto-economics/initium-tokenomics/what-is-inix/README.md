# Initium Native Token

### Initium Native Token

INIX is the native token of the Initium blockchain. To understand it better, INIX plays the same role for the Initium blockchain as Ether in the Ethereum blockchain or BNB in the Binance Chain. This document may use both INITIUM and INI to refer to the Initium native token. Since the mainnet of the Initium blockchain has not yet been launched, INITIUM (INI) will be hosted by partner blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Chain, Polygone, etc.

### INIX Usecases

The Initium community can use INIX in Pre-Genesis and Post-Genesis periods in various cases.&#x20;

#### Pre-Genesis Use cases

Pre-Genesis refers to the period between the end of the INIX official token sales course and the launch of the Initium mainnet. The proposed usecases for INIX during this period are (but are not limited to) as followings:

* Staking pools: the holders of INIX can stake their tokens in the partner exchanges for receiving APY.
* Governance: the holders of INIX can contribute to the ecosystem governance by voting in DAOs.
* Means of Payment: the holders of INIX can use it for the payment of goods/services on the partner platforms.

#### Post-Genesis Usecases

Post-Genesis refers to the time after launching the mainnet of the Initium blockchain. During this period, the INIX will be migrated to the Initium blockchain. The proposed usecases for INIX during this period are (but are not limited to) as followings:

* **Validators' Staking Pools**: the holders of INIX can stake their INIX tokens at the Initium validators to help them in securing the network. In return, validators will reward them with the staking rewards in terms of APY. Staking at the validators has higher APY in comparison to other staking methods.&#x20;
* **Staking Pools**: the holders of INIX can stake their INIX tokens at exchanges and DeFi platforms and receive their staking rewards in terms of APY as per the terms and policies of the pertaining platforms.&#x20;
* **Governance**: the holders of INIX can actively contribute to the Initium DAOs.&#x20;
* **Transaction Fee**: as the Initium native token, INIX will be used as the only means of paying the transaction fees on the network.&#x20;
* **Means of Payment**: the holders of INIX can use it for the payment of goods/services on the Initium ecosystem and partner platforms.
* **Liquidity Providing**: INIX will be the main source of providing liquidity for the INIX Tokens (the tokens of projects in the Initium ecosystem).&#x20;

### Inix Initial Supply&#x20;

The initial supply of INIX is 500,000,000 (five hundred million) which will be generated during the official Token Generation Event (TGE). The TGE will be announced officially by the Initium Foundation and the Initium community can acquire their INIX tokens based on the terms and regulations determined by the Initium Foundation.&#x20;

Since before launching the mainnet of the Initium network, INIX will be a multi-blockchain token, the functions of `mint` and `burn` in the smart contracts will ensure that the accumulated supply on all networks cannot exceed the total supply of the token. &#x20;

The HODLers of INIX can migrate their tokens from one blockchain network to another network by using the Initium Bridge (RedWrap), which enables the conversion of INIX from one network to another. For this, the INIX token on a network of origin (e.g., Ethereum) will be burned by the burn function and, then, will be minted on the destination network (e.g., Binance Chain).&#x20;

After the successful launch of the mainnet of the Initium blockchain, the Initium Bridge will enable the users to wrap the various types of coins and tokens from different blockchain networks into the Initium network too. This enables the users to use the INIX in the DeFi platform on the other blockchain networks and increase the circulating and the demand for the INIX.
