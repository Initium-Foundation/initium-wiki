# Initium Native Token

### Initium Native Token

INITIUM (a.k.a INIX) is the native token of the Initium blockchain. To understand it better, INIX plays the same role for the Initium blockchain as Ether in the Ethereum blockchain or BNB in the Binance Chain. This document may use INITIUM and INIX to refer to the Initium native token. This document may use the terms "native token" or "native coin" to refer to the INIX. Since the mainnet of the Initium blockchain has not yet been launched, INITIUM (INI) will be hosted by partner blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Chain, Polygone, etc.

It's recommended to read [Terminology](../../teminology.md) for further information.&#x20;

### INIX Usecases

In various cases, the Initium community can use INIX in Pre-Genesis and Post-Genesis periods.

**Pre-Genesis Usecases**

The proposed usecases for INIX during this period are (but are not limited to) as followings:

* Staking pools: the holders of INIX can stake their tokens in the partner exchanges for receiving APY.
* Governance: the holders of INIX can contribute to the ecosystem governance by voting in DAOs.
* Means of Payment: the holders of INIX can use it to pay for goods/services on the partner platforms.

**Post-Genesis Usecases**

During this period, the INIX will be migrated to the Initium blockchain. The proposed usecases for INIX during this period are (but are not limited to) as followings:

* **Validators' Staking Pools**: the holders of INIX can stake their INIX tokens at the Initium validators to help them secure the network. In return, validators will reward them with the staking rewards in terms of APY. Staking at the validators has higher APY in comparison to other staking methods.&#x20;
* **Staking Pools**: the holders of INIX can stake their INIX tokens at exchanges and DeFi platforms and receive their staking rewards in terms of APY as per the terms and policies of the pertaining platforms.&#x20;
* **Governance**: the holders of INIX can actively contribute to the Initium DAOs.&#x20;
* **Transaction Fee**: as the Initium native token, INIX will be used as the only means of paying the transaction fees on the network.&#x20;
* **Means of Payment**: the holders of INIX can use it to pay for goods/services on the Initium ecosystem and partner platforms.
* **Liquidity Providing**: INIX will be the main source of liquidity for the INIX Tokens (the tokens of projects in the Initium ecosystem).&#x20;

### Inix Initial Supply&#x20;

The initial supply of INIX is 500,000,000 (five hundred million), which will be generated during the official Token Generation Event (INIX TGE). The Initium Foundation will officially announce the TGE, and the Initium community can acquire INIX tokens during the INIX sales rounds or via the Airdrops.

Since before launching the mainnet of the Initium network, INIX will be a multi-blockchain token, the functions of `mint` and `burn` in the smart contracts will ensure that the accumulated supply on all networks cannot exceed the [_Total Current Supply_](../../teminology.md#total-current-supply) of the token. &#x20;

The owners of INIX can migrate their tokens from one blockchain to another using the Initium Bridge ([RedWrap](../../../../native-crafts/redwrap.md)). For this, the INIX token on a network of origin (e.g., Ethereum) will be burned by the burn function and then minted by the INIX token contract on the destination network (e.g., Binance Chain).&#x20;

After the [Genesis Event](../../teminology.md#genesis-event), the Initium Bridge will enable the users to wrap the various types of coins and tokens from different blockchain networks into the Initium network. This enables the users to use the INIX in the DeFi platform on the other blockchain networks and increase the circulating and the demand for the INIX.

### INIX Hardcap

INIX has a hardcap (maximum supply) of 1,130,720,000 INIX. The [Inflation Schedule](../inflation-schedule.md) explains that the Initium network will reach this hardcap by mining new INIX coins 44 years after the Genesis Event.
