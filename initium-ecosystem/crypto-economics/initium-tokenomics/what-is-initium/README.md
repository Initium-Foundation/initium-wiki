# What is INITIUM?

INITIUM (symbol: INI) is the native coin of the Initium blockchain. To understand it better, INITIUM plays the same role for the Initium blockchain as Ether plays in the Ethereum blockchain, or BNB plays in the Binance Chain. In this document, we may use both INITIUM and INI to refer the native token/coin of the Initium blockchain network.&#x20;

INITIUM (INI) enables the users of the Initium blockchain to use the blockchain services, ranging from transaction fees, deployment of smart contracts and minting NFTs to staking, etc.&#x20;

Since the mainnet of the Initium blockchain has not yet been launched, INITIUM (INI) will be hosted by some partner blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Chain, Polygone, etc.&#x20;

The initial supply of INITIUM is 500,000,000 (five hundred million) which will be generated during the official Token Generation Event (TGE). The TGE will be announced officially by the Initium Foundation and the Initium community can acquire their INITIUM (INI) tokens based on the terms and regulations determined by the Initium Foundation.&#x20;

Since before launching the mainnet of the Initium network, INI will be a multi-blockchain token, the functions of `mint` and `burn` in the smart contracts will ensure that the accumulated supply on all networks cannot exceed the total supply of the token. &#x20;

The HODLers of INI can migrate their tokens from one blockchain network to another network by using the Initium Bridge (RedWrap), which enables the conversion of INITIUM from one network to another. For this, the INITIUM token on a network of origin (e.g., Ethereum) will be burned by the burn function and, then, will be minted on the destination network (e.g., Binance Chain).&#x20;

After the successful launch of the mainnet of the Initium blockchain, the Initium Bridge will enable the users to wrap the various types of coins and tokens from different blockchain networks into the Initium network too. This enables the users to use the INITIUM coin in the DeFi platform on the other blockchain networks and increase the circulating and the demand for the INITIUM coin.&#x20;
