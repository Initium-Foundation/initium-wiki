# Airdrops

In the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, the term “Airdrop” refers to the distribution of digital assets to the public, either by virtue of holding a certain other token or simply by virtue of being an active wallet address on a particular blockchain.

The Initium Foundation may conduct various airdrops for the Initium community.&#x20;

At the TGE of the Initial Supply of INIX token, a total amount of 10,000,000 INIX (equals 2% of the Initial Supply), is dedicated for the airdrop reserves of the Initium network. This reserve will be used for extending the Initium community.&#x20;

#### How the Airdrop Reserves will be used?

The Initium Foundation will use the airdrop reserves in following ways:

* **Independent Airdrops**: refers to the airdrop programs conducted by the Initium Foundation on social media, wallet creation, and community incentives.&#x20;
* **Join Airdrops**: refers to the airdrop programs that the Initium Foundation conducts in partnership with other platforms, including the exchanges, projects, and events.&#x20;

#### Post-Genesis Airdrop Programs
