# Inflation Schedule

### PIntroduction&#x20;

This article will review the Inflation Schedule of Initium protocol and its impact on INIX inflation.

The Inflation Schedule is a protocol-based mechanism for increasing the Total Current Supply of INIX. This mechanism determined the block rewards for every cycle. Each cycle lasts for four years, and the _Halving_ of block rewards will immediately be followed.&#x20;

The Inflation Schedule is a permanent _Regula_ in the Initium Constitution and guarantees that the maximum supply of Initium will not pass the predetermined hardcap of 1,130,720,000 INIX.&#x20;

As mentioned before, the inflation rate of the INIX is subjected to various factors, including [_Initial Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule), [_Dis-Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule), and [_Long Term Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule).&#x20;

At the INIX TGE, there will be 500,000,000 INIX as the Initial Supply which will be distributed according to the [Initium Tokenomics](../../../ecosystem/preface.md). This supply will be considered as the [Total Current Supply](../teminology.md#total-current-supply) of INIX.&#x20;

### Inflation Schedule Mechanism

The main parameter in the Inflation Schedule is the block rewards during a cycle. As mentioned above, each cycle lasts for four years. Each cycle has its _Regula_ for block rewards.&#x20;

The first cycle begins with the Genesis Event, by which the block reward is set at 1 INIX. The new cycle will begin every four years, and the _Halving_ of block rewards will immediately be followed. This mechanism will continue until the 10th cycle after the Genesis Event. Since the block rewards cannot be smaller than allowed lepton decimals (9 decimals), the _Halving_ mechanism will halt at the 11th cycle, and the block reward in this cycle will be as same as the 10th cycle. By end of the 11th cycle (44 years after the Genesis Event), the final leptons will be mined, and the Initium network reaches the predetermined hardcap of 1,130,720,000 INIX.

Initium block time is 0.4 seconds, which means 24 new blocks will be generated every minute.&#x20;

### Distribution of Block Rewards

The block rewards are the main source of inflation in the Initium network. The following mechanism will be implemented for the distribution of each block reward. &#x20;

* **Staking Rewards Pool**: 90% of the block rewards will be allocated to the Staking Rewards Pool to be distributed among the validators and staking participants.&#x20;
* **Initium Foundation**: 10% of the block rewards will be allocated to the Initium Foundation for supporting the ecosystem activities and the [native organizations](../../../about-initium/native-organization.md).&#x20;

**The Effective Inflation Rate**

The inflation rate in the Initium network tends to zero by the end of the 11th cycle. In the first year, the effective inflation rate is \~15.77% which continues in the second year at 13.62%, the third year at 11.99%, and the fourth year at 10.70%.&#x20;

However, by the initiation of the second cycle, the inflation rate dramatically decreases to 4.83% and will be reduced 4.22% in the last year of this cycle.&#x20;

In the third cycle, the inflation rate is around 2.03% and will be reduced to 1.91% in the last year of the cycle. In the fourth cycle, the inflation rate starts at 0.94% and will be reduced to 0.91% in the last year of this cycle. In the fifth cycle, the inflation rate starts at \~0.45% and will be keept roughly around 0.45%.

The chart below, illustrate the effective inflation rate during the 11 cycles.&#x20;
