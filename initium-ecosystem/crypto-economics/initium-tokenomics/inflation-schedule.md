# Inflation Schedule

### Introduction&#x20;

As mentioned before, the inflation rate of the INITIUM is subjected to various factors, including [_Initial Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule), [_Dis-Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule), and [_Long Term Inflation Rate_](../teminology.md#inflation-schedule).&#x20;

At the INITIUM TGE, there will be 500,000,000 INITIUM as the Initial Supply which will be distributed according to the [Initium Tokenomics](../../). This supply will be considered as the [Total Current Supply](../teminology.md#total-current-supply) of the INITIUM.&#x20;

Based on the [Pre-Genesis Period](../#1-pre-genesis-rewards) plan of the INITIUM,  during this course the following HODLers of INITIUM will benefit from APY on the partner staking platforms;

* Validator Investors: as the validator investors would own a maximum of 8% of the Initial Supply (approx. 40,000,000 INITIUM), they will receive their staking rewards by staking their INITIUM tokens on the [Initium Money](https://initium.money) platform. The proposed INITIUM staking APY for the validators' tokens is 15% for the first year.&#x20;
* Public Sales Investors: the estimated public sales will cover 20% of the Initial Supply (approx. 100,000,000 INITIUM). The HODLers of the public tokens will receive their staking rewards by staking their INITIUM tokens on the staking platforms, including the  [Initium Money](https://initium.money) platform. The proposed INITIUM staking APY is 15% for the first year.&#x20;

The estimated rewards for the INITIUM stakers for the Pre-Genesis Period can be calculated as following table (note that we have considered all tokens would be staked.  In the meantime, we have considered that the total staking tokens plus their yield will be staked for the next year as well. Therefore, the figures will vary with the estimations.):

|              |                        |          |            |              |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Staking Year | Initial Staking Supply | APY Rate | Yields     | Total Supply |
| 1            | 150,000,000            | 15%      | 22,500,000 | 172,500,000  |
| 2            | 172,500,000            | 12%      | 20,700,000 | 193,200,000  |
| 3            | 193,200,000            | 10%      | 19,320,000 | 212,520,000  |

By considering that the Initium mainnet will be launched approximately three years after the end of the INITIUM sales event, During the Genesis Year and the Post-Genesis Years, the validators' tokens will not be eligible to be staked in the public pools and should be staked on the validators' wallets. However, after launching the mainnet, the Strategic Sales tokens and Funding & Private Sales tokens are eligible to be staked on the public pools. This will add 60,000,000 new INITIUM to the circulating supply and staking tokens.&#x20;

As mentioned earlier, 30% of the new coins generated by inflationary issuance will be added to the Rewards Pool Reserves for funding the staking rewards. This will create a fair mechanism for the non-validator staking users (e.g., new HODLers, institutional investors, retail investors, etc.) for staking their INITIUM.&#x20;

It's necessary to note that the partner platforms and exchanges can also provide the staking pools with different reward plans and APY rates for INITIUM.&#x20;

Since the majority of the Inflation (60%) is distributed to the validators, this mechanism encourages the HODLers to run new validators joining the network and make it more secure.&#x20;

### The Inflation Rates

The inflation rate during the Pre-Genesis Year is zero, and the network will not create any new token. As mentioned earlier, the HODLers can benefit from staking rewards during this period.&#x20;

The Genesis Year inflation rate is 10% which will add 50,000,000 new coins to the circulating supply by the end of the year. However, the [Fee Burning Mechanism](../transaction-fees.md) will burn 50% of any transaction for the first four years. Although the transaction fees are too small on the INITIUM (by 0.00005 INITIUM per TX), however, the partial fee burning will be very effective for dis-inflation of the INITIUM. By considering 40,000 TXP on the Initium mainnet, the estimated total of 1,261,440,000,000 transactions can take place annually on the Initium network by the total transaction fees of 6,307,200 INITIUM per year. It means that in the first four years of the launching of the mainnet, the total amount of 12,614,400 INITIUM will be burned. For further details, you may read the [Transaction Fees](../transaction-fees.md).&#x20;

The fee burning mechanism will reduce the fee burning every four years cycle by 15%, and after 36 years, there will be no fee burnings.&#x20;

In the second year (one year after Genesis Year), the dis-inflation mechanism will reduce the inflation rate by 15% every year. The inflation rate will continue to dis-inflate and will be zero in the 36 years.&#x20;

### Block Rewards and Inflation&#x20;

As mentioned earlier, the Initium protocol is subjected to the block reward. By considering the blocktime of Initium by 0.4 of a second, every year, 78,840,000 new blocks will be added to the network.&#x20;

Block reward is an important intensive for the validators to be always online and make the Initium network even more secure.&#x20;

Block reward is subjected to the _halving_ mechanism by which the block reward will be reduced by 50% every four years. The halving mechanism will continue to make the block reward zero in 36 years.&#x20;

Since the Genesis block on the Initium network, the block reward will be 1 INITIUM per block which will be rewarded to the Prime Node of every block. Figure 2 illustrates the halving impact on the total added amount of INITIUM to the ecosystem.&#x20;

### The Effective Inflation Rate

By considering all of the above-mentioned factors, the Effective Inflation Rate (EIR) of the INITIUM can be summarized by the table below.

![Figure 3. INITIUM inflation table. ](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 1.45.15 PM.png>)

As illustrated in Figure 3, the _Effective Inflation Rate_ tends to be below 1% after 17 years, and the estimated Maximum Supply of the INITIUM would be around **1,739,581,608**. It's important to note that this amount would be changed by some internal factors including the number of actual transactions per block (higher or lower than the estimated amount of transactions), the token burn by the users, etc.

![Figure 4. The Effective Inflation Rate of INITIUM from the Genesis Year. ](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 1.57.25 PM.png>)

As illustrated in Figure 4, the Effective Inflation Rate of INITIUM will sharply decline from the second year and will tend to be below 1% after 17 years and finally will be zero in the year 36.&#x20;

### Inflation Distribution&#x20;

The suggested Inflation Schedule in this proposal is highly effective to encourage both validators and users. This proposal is supported by high incentives for both validators and users to stake their INITIUM coins to receive the rewards.&#x20;

Based on the Inflation Distribution Plan, the new coins generated by the inflation schedule will be distributed as follows:

* Validators Reward Pool: 40%
* Staking Rewards Pool: 40%
* Initium Foundation (Reserves): 10%
* DAO Funds: 10%&#x20;

_**Validators**_: The validators' rewards will be aggregated in the _Validators Reward Pool_ and will be distributed among the validators according to the factors including their uptime and contribution to the network. The total staked INITIUM by a given validator also is a critical factor for calculating their share from the inflation. This factor is considered as % Staked INITIUM which is calculated as below:

_% INITIUM Staked= Validator INITIUM Staked  ​/ Total INITIUM Staked by Validators_

A given validator with 100% uptime will receive 100% of its rewards, however, a validator with 50% uptime will receive 50% of its rewards.&#x20;

In the meantime, validators with higher INITIUM Staked have a higher share of the _Validators Rewards Pool._ This mechanism encourages the validators to 1) keep their nodes always uptime to secure the network and  2) stake more INITIUM to increase their pool share.&#x20;

This is important to note that in the validators' staking rewards are calculated annually and can be claimed annually. Frequent staking and unstaking will affect their effective % INITIUM Staked.&#x20;

_**HODLers**_: The HODLers who stake their INITIUM will receive their staking rewards from the _Staking Rewards Pool._ In this case, their % INITIUM Staked will be calculated as below:&#x20;

_% INITIUM Staked=  INITIUM Staked  ​/ Current Total Supply_&#x20;

The rewards from the _Staking Rewards Pool_ can be claimed daily, however,  frequent staking and unstaking will affect their effective % INITIUM Staked.&#x20;

The INITIUM staking via validators can be more profitable for the HODLers since the validators have a higher ROI on their staking pools. This mechanism also will encourage the exchanges, staking service providers, and individual investors to run Initium validators by receiving support from the INITIUM HODLers, which results in a more secure network.&#x20;

_**Initium Foundation**_: As mentioned earlier, 10% of the new coins generated by the Inflation Schedule will be distributed to the Initium Foundation. These funds will be used by the foundation for promoting the Initium ecosystem, operational expenses, marketing, training, and community works. The Initium Foundation will publish its annual reports about the use of funds and the activities to provide the Initium community with the expected transparency.&#x20;

_**DAO Funds**_: As mentioned earlier, 10% of the new coins generated by the Inflation Schedule will be distributed to the Initium DAO. These funds will be used by the DAO for supporting new projects on the initium network. The allocation of funds will be based on the votes of the DAO members, and the Initium Foundation will supervise the use of funds by the projects to make sure that the allocated funds are used in the right way.&#x20;
