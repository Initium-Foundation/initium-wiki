# Crypto Economics

&#x20;Initium's crypto-economic system is designed to promote a healthy, long-term, self-sustaining economy with participant incentives aligned to the security and decentralization of the network.&#x20;

The main participants in this economy are validation clients. Their contributions to the network, state validation, and requisite incentive mechanisms are discussed in this document.&#x20;

The other participants in this crypto-economy are the HODLers. They are the users that stake their INITIUM coins in Initium's staking pools and receive an annual percentage yield (APY) for staking their coins and reducing the free supply of the INITIUM in the market. Their contribution to the network and requisite incentive mechanism are discussed in this document.&#x20;
