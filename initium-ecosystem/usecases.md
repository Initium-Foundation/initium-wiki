# Usecases

The Initium ecosystem is designed to cover most of the innovations and applications of blockchain technology in business and life. Here is a review of the areas that the Initium ecosystem seeks to extend. The Initium Foundation will support the eligible projects for joining the ecosystem.&#x20;

### Wallets

The Initium wallets are non-custodial wallets to keep the users' private and public keys to store, send, and receive the cryptographic assets, including the Initium tokens and NFTs. The wallets will be of various types, from Web extensions to hardware wallets.&#x20;

### DeFi platforms

DeFi platforms are an essential part of the Initium ecosystem for providing liquidity, staking, and swap services to the Initium community. Currently, the Initium Foundation has planned to develop numerous DeFi platforms, which will be announced in the future to the Initium community.&#x20;

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are becoming integral to any progressive blockchain ecosystem; therefore, the Initium network plans to be one of the most popular blockchain networks for creating NFTs. Due to its high scalability, low cost, immediate finality, and ease of use, we expect the Initium to become one of the most popular blockchains for NFTs.&#x20;

### Micropayments&#x20;

One of the main advantages of the Initium Network is its scalability and low-cost transactions, which makes it an ideal network for micropayments. Financial institutions and payment processing networks (like Visa or MasterCard) can also benefit from the Initium blockchain to benefit from rapid and low-cost transactions.&#x20;

### **GameFi**

GameFi, a portmanteau of "game" and "finance," refers to **blockchain games that offer economic incentives to the people that play them**. Typically players earn in-game rewards like crypto tokens, virtual land, avatars, and other NFTs by completing tasks, battling other players, or progressing through various game levels. Due to its outstanding architecture and scalability, the initium blockchain will provide a highly scalable, flexible, and sustainable context for developing and launching the GameFi platforms.&#x20;

### **Do-to-Earn**&#x20;

This area consists of various activity-based dApps including "learn-to-earn", "create-to-earn", "watch-to-earn", etc. Due to its outstanding architecture and scalability, the initium blockchain will provide a highly scalable, flexible, and sustainable context for developing and launching the DOE platforms.&#x20;

### **Private Blockchains**

The architecture of the Initium blockchain enables businesses to configure and launch their permission-based blockchain networks on the Initium blockchain. This is one of the unique advantages of the Initium blockchain. Private blockchains are a fast-developing segment, and Initium can provide a configurable, highly scalable, secure, fast, and flexible environment for businesses to launch their private blockchain networks.&#x20;

### **BaaS**

Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies building blockchain applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the growing field of blockchain technology. Baas providers are one-stop shops for DApp developers to deploy and manage any permissions or permissionless blockchain applications.&#x20;

### **IoT**

Theoretically, the Initium blockchain can process a transaction in a fraction of a second. Our preliminary results show that Covenant achieves a worst-case synchronization error of 37 _Âµs (_0.037 _ms_) __ in a multi-hop network of up to 10 hops. It is ideal scalability for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and networks. In addition, the security and the transparency provided by the Initium networks give the desired level of transparency and security to the decentralized IoT devices. The low-cost transaction fee makes the Initium network cost-effective for IoT services.&#x20;
