# Stakeholders

The Initium Foundation aims to establish a sustainable, diversified, and profitable ecosystem through the initium network, a decentralized and highly web scalable blockchain network for running dApps and marketplaces.&#x20;

The Initium ecosystem refers to a suite of technologies that work synergistically with the protocol to boost its speed and scalability, and to a collection of dApps that are built on Solanaâ€™s open infrastructure. Anyone can start building on the ecosystem, thanks to its open protocol and suite of developer resources.

### Stakeholders

The Initium ecosystem consists of various stakeholders, each playing a critical role in the success of the entire ecosystem. These stakeholders are:

**1) The Initium Foundation**: as a DAO, the Initium Foundation plays a centric role in the ecosystem by managing the progress of the successful development and the implementation of the ecosystem modules. The Initium Foundation also synchronizes the collaboration of the ecosystem stakeholders and prominent players to enhance ecosystem integrity and sustainability. As mentioned earlier, the Initium Foundation is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that embraces significant players and participants of the ecosystem, including:

* **The Primes**: the founder team of the Initium Foundation and the Initium protocol who formed the initial core of the foundation. Primes have no specific advantages over the other members of the foundation. They're also committed to running the validators on their own by acquiring the Validator License.&#x20;
* **Validators**: as critical stakeholders of the Initium network, validators are an integral part of the Initium Foundation. Their votes are crucial for implementing the changes to the Initium protocol.&#x20;
* **HODLers of INI token.**
* &#x20;**Initium Labs**: as the technical wing of the Initium Foundation, the Initium Foundation is also an inherent authority to participate in the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* **Initium Developers Community**: As a DAO, the Initium Developers Community is an affiliation of the Initium Labs that facilitates collaboration among the developers.&#x20;

**2) Initium Labs**: established by the Initium Foundation, the Initium Labs is the technical authority of the Initium ecosystem and is responsible for the development, implementation, and improvement of the Initium protocol. The Initium Labs interacts and cooperates with the developers joining the Initium Developers' Community to elaborate the innovations and development of the new platforms and protocols on the Initium network. For further information, you may visit https://initium.one.

**3) Initium Developers Community**: as a DAO, the Initium Developers Community (ICD) is a globally distributed home to developers, token holders, validators, and members supporting the protocol. Initium Labs conducts the ICD Initiatives Program to reward the developers for their collaboration and participation in developing the Initium network and ecosystem. In the meantime, the ICD is where the Certified Initium Developers (CIDs) are available to be hired for new projects, institutions, and organizations. For further information, you may visit https://initium.team.&#x20;

**4) Initium VC**: as a DAO ([Dinarios](../about-initium/initium-daos.md#types-of-initium-daos)) of the Initium ecosystem, the Initium VC is assigned to support the Initium community activities and provide financial incentives to eligible projects joining the Initium ecosystem. The assets of the Initium Reserves Fund are managed by the Initium Foundation, while the DAO members vote on their allocations. This is necessary to not that the Initium Reserves Fund is different from Initium Foundation Reserves.&#x20;

**5) Initium Projects**: the projects joining the Initium ecosystem play an essential role in its success. These projects would be in various fields, including Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, etc. These projects use the Initium blockchain to run their applications, store data, and issue tokens.

**6) Business Partners**: Initium Foundation aims to establish strategic partnerships with the leading organizations and projects in the blockchain ecosystem. These partners include (but are not limited to) the exchanges, tech companies, blockchain protocols, platforms, etc.   &#x20;

**7) Initium community**: the initium community plays an essential role in the sustainability, progress, and success of the Initium ecosystem. We use the term "**Initiumer**" (Initiumers for plural) to address the community members of the Initium ecosystem. Initumers can be individuals or organizations that use the Initium ecosystem or show their support from the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;
