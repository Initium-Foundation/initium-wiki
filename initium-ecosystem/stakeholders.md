# Stakeholders

The Initium Foundation aims to establish a sustainable, diversified, and profitable ecosystem through the initium network, a decentralized and highly web scalable blockchain network for running dApps and marketplaces.&#x20;

The Initium ecosystem refers to a suite of technologies that work synergistically with the protocol to boost its speed and scalability, and to a collection of dApps that are built on Solana’s open infrastructure. Anyone can start building on the ecosystem, thanks to its open protocol and suite of developer resources.

### Stakeholders

The Initium ecosystem consists of various stakeholders, each playing a critical role in the success of the entire ecosystem. These stakeholders are:

**1) The Initium Foundation**: as a DAO, the Initium Foundation plays a centric role in the ecosystem by managing the progress of the successful development and the implementation of the ecosystem modules. The Initium Foundation also synchronizes the collaboration of the ecosystem stakeholders and prominent players to enhance ecosystem integrity and sustainability. As mentioned earlier, the Initium Foundation is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that embraces significant players and participants of the ecosystem, including:

* The Primes: the founder team of the Initium Foundation and the Initium protocol who formed the initial core of the foundation. Primes have no specific advantages over the other members of the foundation. They're also committed to running the validators on their own by acquiring the Validator License.&#x20;
* Validators: as critical stakeholders of the Initium network, validators are an integral part of the Initium Foundation. Their votes are crucial for implementing the changes to the Initium protocol.&#x20;
* Stakers: the HODLers are individuals or organizations who stake their Initium network token (IOT). They are eligible HODLers to join the Initium Foundation and participate in the DAO by submitting the proposals and voting in the voting sessions.&#x20;
* &#x20;Initium Labs: as the technical wing of the Initium Foundation, the Initium Foundation is also an inherent authority to participate in the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* Initium Developers Community: As a DAO, the Initium Developers Community is an affiliation of the Initium Labs that facilitates collaboration among the developers.&#x20;

**2) Initium Labs**: established by the Initium Foundation, the Initium Labs is the technical authority of the Initium ecosystem and is responsible for the development, implementation, and improvement of the Initium protocol. The Initium Labs interacts and cooperates with the developers joining the Initium Developers' Community to elaborate the innovations and development of the new platforms and protocols on the Initium network. For further information, you may visit https://initium.one.

**3) Initium Developers Community**: as a DAO, the Initium Developers Community (ICD) is a globally distributed home to developers, token holders, validators, and members supporting the protocol. Initium Labs conducts the ICD Initiatives Program to reward the developers for their collaboration and participation in developing the Initium network and ecosystem. In the meantime, the ICD is where the Certified Initium Developers (CIDs) are available to be hired for new projects, institutions, and organizations. For further information, you may visit https://initium.team.&#x20;

**4) Initium Fund**: as a DAO of the Initium ecosystem, the Initium Fund is assigned to support the Initium community activities and provide financial incentives to eligible projects joining the Initium ecosystem. The assets of the Initium Fund are managed by the Initium Foundation, while the DAO members vote on their allocations.&#x20;

**5) Initium Projects**: the projects joining the Initium ecosystem play an essential role in its success. These projects would be in various fields, including Web 3.0, DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, etc. These projects use the Initium blockchain to run their applications, store data, and issue tokens.

**6) Business Partners**: Initium Foundation aims to establish strategic partnerships with the leading organizations and projects in the blockchain ecosystem. These partners include (but are not limited to) the exchanges, tech companies, blockchain protocols, platforms, etc.   &#x20;

**7) Initium community**: the initium community plays an essential role in the sustainability, progress, and success of the Initium ecosystem. We use the term "**Initiumer**" (Initiumers for plural) to address the community members of the Initium ecosystem. Initumers can be individuals or organizations that use the Initium ecosystem or show their support from the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;

## Initium Usecases&#x20;

The Initium ecosystem is designed to cover most of the innovations and applications of blockchain technology in business and life. Here is a review of the areas that the Initium ecosystem seeks to extend. The Initium Foundation will support the eligible projects for joining the ecosystem.&#x20;

### Wallets

The Initium wallets are non-custodial wallets to keep the users' private and public keys to store, send, and receive the cryptographic assets, including the Initium tokens and NFTs. The wallets will be of various types, from Web extensions to hardware wallets.&#x20;

### DeFi platforms

DeFi platforms are an essential part of the Initium ecosystem for providing liquidity, staking, and swap services to the Initium community. Currently, the Initium Foundation has planned to develop numerous DeFi platforms, which will be announced in the future to the Initium community.&#x20;

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are becoming integral to any progressive blockchain ecosystem; therefore, the Initium network plans to be one of the most popular blockchain networks for creating NFTs. Due to its high scalability, low cost, immediate finality, and ease of use, we expect the Initium to become one of the most popular blockchains for NFTs.&#x20;

### Micropayments&#x20;

One of the main advantages of the Initium Network is its scalability and low-cost transactions, which makes it an ideal network for micropayments. Financial institutions and payment processing networks (like Visa or MasterCard) can also benefit from the Initium blockchain to benefit from rapid and low-cost transactions.&#x20;

### **GameFi**

GameFi, a portmanteau of "game" and "finance," refers to **blockchain games that offer economic incentives to the people that play them**. Typically players earn in-game rewards like crypto tokens, virtual land, avatars, and other NFTs by completing tasks, battling other players, or progressing through various game levels. Due to its outstanding architecture and scalability, the initium blockchain will provide a highly scalable, flexible, and sustainable context for developing and launching the GameFi platforms.&#x20;

### **Do-to-Earn**&#x20;

This area consists of various activity-based dApps including "learn-to-earn", "create-to-earn", "watch-to-earn", etc. Due to its outstanding architecture and scalability, the initium blockchain will provide a highly scalable, flexible, and sustainable context for developing and launching the DOE platforms.&#x20;

### **Private Blockchains**

The architecture of the Initium blockchain enables businesses to configure and launch their permission-based blockchain networks on the Initium blockchain. This is one of the unique advantages of the Initium blockchain. Private blockchains are a fast-developing segment, and Initium can provide a configurable, highly scalable, secure, fast, and flexible environment for businesses to launch their private blockchain networks.&#x20;

### **BaaS**

Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies building blockchain applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the growing field of blockchain technology. Baas providers are one-stop shops for DApp developers to deploy and manage any permissions or permissionless blockchain applications.&#x20;

### **IoT**

Theoretically, the Initium blockchain can process a transaction in a fraction of a second. Our preliminary results show that Covenant achieves a worst-case synchronization error of 37 _µs (_0.037 _ms_) __ in a multi-hop network of up to 10 hops. It is ideal scalability for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and networks. In addition, the security and the transparency provided by the Initium networks give the desired level of transparency and security to the decentralized IoT devices. The low-cost transaction fee makes the Initium network cost-effective for IoT services.&#x20;
