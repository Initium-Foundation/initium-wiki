# Introduction

Validators form the backbone of the Initium network. By processing transactions and participating in consensus, each validator helps make Initium the most high-performance blockchain network in the world.

Anyone can run a validator, however, there are some requirements for being a validator.&#x20;

Validators can earn INI for helping secure the Initium network. It follows the Initium economics, and validators will receive staking rewards. Validators also help increase censorship resistance on the network by increasing decentralization.

Every Validator on the Initium network is tagged with a name that the Validator can choose. Validators can run their websites and cooperate with the Initium community for INI staking. Since the validators will receive the more significant portion of the Initium Inflation, staking on validators is more profitable for the INI holders.
