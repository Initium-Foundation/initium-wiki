# Introduction to Initium

### **What Does Mean Initium?**

Initium is a Latin word and means "the beginning." This name is adopted as Initium is the beginning of a new generation of innovations in the blockchain ecosystem.&#x20;

### What is Initium?

Initium is an open-source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain, based on Rust. The Initium Foundation is a non-for-profit decentralized autonomous organization (DAP) that maintains the development of the open-source project and encourages contributions to the projects. For more information, you may visit [https://initium.foundation](https://initium.foundation).

### Why Initium?

Developing a new blockchain architecture by considering Vitalik Buterin's trilemma is a challenging task as the developers face three significant challenges, decentralization, security, and scalability. It's widely believed that the blockchains are built to force developers to sacrifice one of the aspects in favor of the two, as they can only provide two of the three benefits at any given time.

Although scalability is an essential issue for broader adoption of the blockchain technology, especially for micropayments and dApps, the developers and users need an optimum network that can provide them with three benefits of the blockchain.

Time synchronization among network partners is a fundamental requirement for efficient and reliable communication on a global scale. Typical synchronization schemes like NTP operate on a trust-based client-server model, which does not scale well in a decentralized network. Single server failures can lead to severe downtime before re-establishing synchronization.

Initium's consensus, the Proof of Synchronization (PoSync), also called Covenant, will provide a seamless solution for synchronizing the nodes throughout the network, which is highly cost-effective while keeping the decentralization, security, and scalability. It makes the Initium a potential network to be used by IoT machines, dApps, marketplaces, and micropayments.

Initium aims to provide a context for developers and innovators to build and run more reliable, decentralized, and efficient applications. The key advantages of Initium can be summarized below:

* Innovative
* Decentralization
* Low-cost transactions&#x20;
* Fast deployment of smart contracts
* Rapid Finality&#x20;
* Scalability&#x20;
* Security&#x20;
* Capable of running the complex smart contracts&#x20;
* Easy integration&#x20;
* Community driven&#x20;
* Community governed&#x20;
