# Job Vacancies

Job vacancies are available on [https://jobs.initium.team](https://jobs.initium.team), where you can find the open job vacancies by the Initium Foundation, Initium Labs, and the other teams, organizations, or projects in the Initium ecosystem. However, the Initium community members, especially the contributors to the Initium Premium program, have the priority to apply for these jobs.
