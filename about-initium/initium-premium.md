# Initium Premium

Initium Premium is a program to help Initium supporters contribute to the ecosystem and work with core teams. The ecosystem needs you no matter your passion â€” community management, content creation, social media, events, tech support, or anything else

### How does Initium Premium work?

It's very simple! If you are interested to join the Initium Premium program, it means that you, as an initiumer, are interested in contributing actively to the growth and development of the Initium ecosystem. The Initium Premium is a program to:

* Provide incentives to the Initium supporters' contributions to the ecosystem with INI tokens.&#x20;
* Organize the Initium supporters' contributions to the ecosystem.
* Promote the Initium supporters in the ecosystem and lead them to achieve high-rank organizational levels in the Initium Foundation.&#x20;
* Empowering the Initium teams and supporters to add more value to the ecosystem.&#x20;
* Promote the formation of community organizations (including [initium-chapters.md](initium-chapters.md "mention")) around the world.&#x20;
* Enable the Initium supporters to build their careers in the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;

### Benefits of joining the Initium Premium Program

* Get connected to the Initium supporters: join a powerful community of creative, open-minded Initium supporters from around the world.
* Reach the heart of the ecosystem: become a key contributor to the Initium Foundation and the greater Initium ecosystem.
* Build your career: get real-world experience. Build communities in the blockchain field and gain new marketable skills to help push your career to new heights.
* Early access: see things before anyone else. Get early access to Initium ecosystem projects, participate in closed projects, and give feedback directly to core developers.
* Exclusive opportunities: access multiple closed opportunities like non-public job postings for openings across the Initium ecosystem, support at core events, unique workshops, and the opportunity to apply for Premium-only grants (e.g., establishing an Initium Chapter or even being promoted to a Prime)!
* Meet the Core: have direct communication with the core Initium Labs and Initium Foundation teams. This includes monthly calls with different members (e.g., marketing, engineering, and business development), as well as numerous representatives of Initium ecosystem projects.
* Get exclusive rewards: have the chance to get rewards from the Initium Premium Funds by the Initium Foundation and the exclusive Premium NFTs for your contributions and support to the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;
