# Initium Primes

Primes are the core team of the Initium Foundation, who created the idea behind the Initium ecosystem and contributed fully to developing and realizing the Initium blockchain.

They are the highest rank members of the Initium Foundation and have significant authority to secure the Initium ecosystem and keep it on its track for accomplishing its missions.

The Primes follow the rule of 3-5-7. The number 3 represents the three pillars of the Initium (shown in the Initium Logo). It also means the three first Primes of the Initium Foundation, whose position is permanent in the foundation. The Number 5 represents the minimum number of the Primes for making official any Primes' meeting, decision, proposal, or veto. And the number 7 represents the number of Primes in the Initium Foundation. It's important to note that excluding the three first Primes, the other Primes can be elected or changed by the Initium community votes.

The contributors to the Initium community have the chance to be promoted to become a Prime through their achievements and contributions to the ecosystem and receive significant support in DAO from the Initium Community. For more information, you may read [initium-premium.md](initium-premium.md "mention").

Like any other members of the Initium community, the Primes also have equal write for voting, with some exemptions as follows:

* Request for revote: if a proposal has not received enough attention from the community for voting, the number of votes was not significant, or there was a low contribution, a Prime can request for revoting of the proposal.
* Veto: the veto is the right of every Prime to ban a DAO proposal. However, at least 5 Primes should use their veto rights for an effective veto. It's important to note that, after the veto, a Prime still can request a revote. Using veto right is subject to "Primes' Code of Conduct" and cannot be easily manipulated. It's a mechanism for ensuring a proposal is not damaging the future of the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;
* Prime Proposals: a DAO proposal tagged with #prime is the proposal that one or some of the Primes has proposed and can go directly for DAOs voting.&#x20;
