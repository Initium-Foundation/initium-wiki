# How to Join Initium

Initium is an open-source and open-to-join project. Individuals, organizations, institutions, and teams can join the Initium community and projects. Initium Foundation rewards the community members in various programs.&#x20;

[Initium Premium](initium-premium.md) is a special program run by the Initium Foundation to provide incentives to the community members who actively support Initium and contribute to the activities. There are dozens of tasks that you can accomplish to support the Initium ecosystem.&#x20;

### How can I join Initium?

First, we recommend studying the [Initium Premium](initium-premium.md) program to get more information about the benefits of joining Initium and the roles that you can contribute to the ecosystem and work with core teams, including the Primes.&#x20;

Currently, there are three major categories for joining the Initium:

### Contributors

Every individual or team interested in the Initium can apply to be a contributor to the ecosystem. These users will receive the contributor badge on the Initium ecosystem and will benefit from the Initium Premium rewards. Based on their tasks and fields of activity, there would be organized to work with an Initium Premium member.&#x20;

Usually, a contributor needs to spend a minimum of four hours a week on activity for their contribution to the Initium. There are various activities for the contributors to join the ecosystem, ranging from social media, content creation, design and graphics, coding, tutoring, etc. Depending on their activities and performance, the contributor members will be eligible to receive the rewards from Initium Premium Fund.

### Ambassadors&#x20;

Ambassadors are the individuals or teams that significantly contribute to the Initium ecosystem. Contributors who show high performance and contribution to Initium will be eligible to be promoted to the Initium Ambassador. Ambassadors will benefit from greater benefits to the contributors, including the Ambassador badge, access to the Initium training programs, meetups, early access to the projects, opening an [Initium Chapter](initium-chapters.md) in their region, and exclusive opportunities.

Initium Foundation expects that an Initium Ambassador spends a minimum of 12 hours a week on activity for their contribution to the Initium. Ambassadors work closely with the Premiums and have the chance to be promoted to the Initium Premium level.

### Premiums

Initium Premium is the highest rank of contribution among the Initium community. The Premium members (a.k.a. Premiums) are the dedicated individuals and teams that dedicate their efforts to their contribution to the Initium ecosystem development and growth.

The Premiums are eligible to the member of Initium Foundation committees via the DAOs. These members will receive significant benefits from the Initium Foundation for their contributions to the Initium ecosystem, including working with the Primes, special funds from the Initium Foundation, etc.

According to their specialization and fields of expertise, Premiums will lead the Contributors. The Premiums are eligible to be promoted to the Primes if they receive significant support in DAO from the Initium community.
