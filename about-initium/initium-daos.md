# Initium DAOs

### Introduction&#x20;

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.

DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members. Decisions are made via proposals the group votes on during a specified period.

### How does a DAO work? <a href="#contentref_0" id="contentref_0"></a>

As mentioned above, a DAO is an organization where decisions get made from the bottom-up; a collective of members owns the organization. There are various ways to participate in a DAO, usually through the ownership of a token.

DAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. Smart contracts are deployed on numerous blockchains nowadays, though Ethereum was the first to use them.

These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals.

This model prevents DAOs from being spammed with proposals: A proposal will only pass once the majority of stakeholders approve it. How that majority is determined varies from DAO to DAO and is specified in the smart contracts.

DAOs are fully autonomous and transparent. As they are built on open-source blockchains, anyone can view their code. Anyone can also audit their built-in treasuries, as the blockchain records all financial transactions. The figure below illustrates the components of a DAO.&#x20;

### Why do we need DAOs? <a href="#contentref_2" id="contentref_2"></a>

Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.

Trusting that code is easier to do as it’s publicly available and can be extensively tested before launch. Every action a DAO takes after being launched has to be approved by the community and is completely transparent and verifiable.

Such an organization has no hierarchical structure. Yet, it can still accomplish tasks and grow while being controlled by stakeholders via its native token. The lack of a hierarchy means any stakeholder can put forward an innovative idea that the entire group will consider and improve upon. Internal disputes are often easily solved through the voting system, in line with the pre-written rules in the smart contract.

By allowing investors to pool funds, DAOs also give them a chance to invest in early-stage startups and decentralized projects while sharing the risk or any profits that may come out of them.

### Why do we run Initium Foundation DAO?

Initium Foundation is assigned to developing, pursuing, and promoting the Initium network blockchain and ecosystem in participation with the participants and the stakeholders.&#x20;

As Initium aims to be a fully decentralized network, the decentralization of its principle organizations will enable the users, developers, and the community to actively participate in the future of the network and the ecosystem.&#x20;

### Types of Initium DAOs

To enhance the efficiency and the authority of the Initium community decision makings, the Initium Foundation has classified the DAOs into different categories as follows:

**General DAO**: a.k.a. the **Covenant DAO**, this DAO is the highest authority in the Initium DAOs where all of the stakeholders of the Initium community can contribute to the votings. This DAO decided on the governance of the entire ecosystem. Most of the approved proposals on the other Initium's DAOs need to get final approval from the Covenant DAO.&#x20;

**Initium Developers Community** **DAO**: a.k.a. **Blox DAO**, this DAO is the authorized body in the Initium DAOs for accepting, rejecting, and implementing any proposals regarding the changes to the Initium protocol codes and standards. Depending on the impact of a given proposal, such a proposal may need to be approved by the _Covenant DAO_ to be officially approved by the Initium community and stakeholders.&#x20;

**Initium VC DAO**: a.k.a. **Denarius DAO**, this DAO is the authorized body in the Initium DAOs for accepting, rejecting, and implementing any proposals regarding the allocation and the use of Initium Treasury Funds for supporting the new projects, acquisitions of the new startups by the Initium Foundation, airdrops, etc. In some cases, the approved proposals may need to get final approval from the Covenant DAO.&#x20;

**Initium Chapters' DAO**: a.k.a. **Collectio DAO**, this DAO is restricted to the members of a given Initium Chapter. The decisions of this DAO are restricted to the related Initium Chapter, however, the chapters can conduct joint DAO for the relations between themselves.&#x20;

### DAO Proposals

Proposals play an important role in DAOs, including the Initium Foundation. The proposals and the votes of the Initium community members set the way forward, the changes, and the way of allocations and managing the DAO funds to the Initium ecosystem, projects, etc.&#x20;

#### **Proposal Tags**

There are six general tags of DAO proposals:

* **Prime** **Proposals (#prime)**: proposals with this tag are the proposals offered by the Initium Foundation Prime Members. Such proposals can be immediately implemented after getting the required votes from the DAO.&#x20;
* **Native Proposals (#native)**: these are the proposals offered by the native platforms and projects of the Initium ecosystem. Depending on the proposal's content, they may need approval from different Initium DAOs.&#x20;
* **Community Proposals (#community)**: these are the proposals offered by the community members of the Initium ecosystem. Depending on their impact on the Initium ecosystem, these proposals may require final approval by the _Covenant DAO_.&#x20;
* **Tech Proposals (#tech)**: there are proposals regarding the technical issues of the Initium ecosystem. Such proposals first need to be approved in **Blox DAO**.&#x20;
* Initium Chapters' Proposals (#chapter): one or more Initium Chapters provide proposals to the DAOs of the Initium. Depending on the proposal's scale, a #chapter proposal may be restricted for voting by the chapter members or be open for other community members to vote.
* **Partner Proposals (#partner)**: these are the proposals offered by the platforms, institutions, and projects that have been integrated with the Initium protocol and/or supporting it. Such proposals need to be reviewed by the Initium Foundation to be eligible for voting in the pertaining DAO. &#x20;
* **Alien Proposals (#alien)**: these are the proposals offered by the organizations, platforms, and institutions out of the Initium ecosystem (e.g., a platform is running on another blockchain, an exchange, hedge fund, etc.). Such proposals need to be reviewed by the Initium Foundation to be eligible for voting in the pertaining DAO.

#### **Type of DOA proposals**

There are five types of proposals in the Initium DAO as followings:

* **Governance Proposals (#gov)**: this means the non-binding, advisory proposals to adopt certain governance provisions on the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* **Project Proposals (#prp)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on joining a project in the Initium ecosystem to become a candidate for receiving funds and support from the Initium Foundation and the partner VCs. The approved candidate(s) will be eligible for "Binding Action Proposals."
* **Binding Action Proposals (#bap)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on binding actions that will result in changes to Initium DAO's smart contracts. This can include allocating some of DAO funds to a project in the ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Change and Improvement Proposals (#cip)**: these proposals allow the community to vote on the change and improvements to the Initium code of conduct, protocol improvements, etc.&#x20;
* **Election Proposals (#elc)**: these proposals allow the community to contribute to the elections in the Initium Foundation's positions, including the Initium Chapters, Primes' election, committees' elections, etc.&#x20;

Approved DAO proposals will be stored at [Initium Foundation's GitHub](https://github.com/Initium-Foundation) for future reference.&#x20;
