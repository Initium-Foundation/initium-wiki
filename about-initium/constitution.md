# Constitution

The Initium Constitution (_Constitution_) is a unique feature of the Initium protocol, which significantly improves the ecosystem's confidence and security. It is a set of rules that govern the protocol. These rules are called _Regula_. Every Regula is set for a purpose in the Constitution.

The Initium community governs the Constitution, and they can set a new Regula and alter or terminate an existing Regula in Covenant DAO. The implementation of changes to the Constitution needs at least 51% of the Initium validators to execute it.

Initium Constitution contains two categories of Regulas:

* Permanent Regulas: refers to the Regulas set at the Genesis Event and govern the network's key issues, including account creation, Inflation Schedule, etc. These Regulas cannot be changed.&#x20;
*   Temporary Regulas: these are the Regulas set by the Genesis Event or the community and are subject to change. This includes transaction fees mechanism (fixed or congestive), transaction restrictions, etc. Initium community can set these Regulas in [Covenant DAO](broken-reference).&#x20;

### **The Advantages of the Constitution**&#x20;

Most existing blockchain networks suffer from spam and spoiling activities (e.g., hacker attacks on the DeFi platform). To solve such problems, Initium benefits from the Constitution concept for regulating the network by its community. Initium community can set Regular for preventing any harmful activity or attack that threatens their funds and the stability of the ecosystem. In the meantime, the Constitution prevents abuses from the network by illegal activities.

### Role of Constitution in Transactions&#x20;

The Supervisor node is responsible for checking every transaction to meet the Regulas of the Constitution. For example, suppose the hackers steal the funds of the Initium community members on an exchange. In that case, they can propose a Regula for blocking that tokens in the ecosystem and prevent their laundry by the hackers. In such a case, the Supervisor nodes won't let those funds transaction from the hackers' wallets.&#x20;

### Constitution and Decentralization&#x20;

We believe that this is the absolute right of the Initium community to rule and control the entire ecosystem without manipulation from the founder team or any other parties. The Initium Constitution is a mechanism that ensures the decentralization of the ecosystem by assigning governance rights to the community. It provides that no centralized body can control the Initium protocol, and the community fully controls the ecosystem.
