# Initium Chapters

Initium Chapters are community-oriented organizations worldwide that aim to promote the Initium ecosystem in their territory. An Initium Chapter can be established by an [Initium Ambassador](how-to-join-initium.md#ambassadors) or [Initium Premium member](how-to-join-initium.md#premiums) in a given region.&#x20;

### How Does Initium Foundation Support the Chapters?

The Initium Chapters are non-governmental organization (NGO) types organizations and receive financial, administrative, technical, and tutorial support from the Initium Foundation. Every chapter may receive special missions from the Initium Foundation.&#x20;

### The Mission of Initium Chapters

The primary missions of the Initium Chapters are (but are not restricted to) as followings:

* Organizing their region's activities related to the Initium community, including the Initium Premium program.
* Promoting the initium ecosystem among their community.&#x20;
* To contribute to the Initium Foundation's activities and programs in their region.&#x20;
* Advising the Initium Foundation for implementing effective plans and strategies for promoting the Initium ecosystem in their region.&#x20;
* To contribute to the localization of the documentation of the Initium ecosystem in their local language(s).&#x20;
* Effective collaboration with the initium community in their region.&#x20;

### How is an Initium Chapter Managed?

Chapters are types of DAO, and they can interact with their community members through the [Collectio DAO](../gov/initium-daos.md). To distinguish their proposals from the other proposals in the Collectio DAO, a chapter needs to generate its tag (e.g., #usa to refer to the Initium Chapter in the USA).&#x20;

Their proposals are tagged with the #chapter tag in the other Initium DAOs.&#x20;

### Type of Initium Chapters

Initium Chapters are categorized into regional forms as follows:

#### Continental Chapters

These chapters are formed by the contribution of all nationwide chapters in a given continent. There are:

* North America Chapter: USA and Canada
* Latina Chapter: Central and South America
* Europe Chapter: All European countries&#x20;
* Africa Chapter: All African countries
* Asia and Pacific: All countries in Asia and the Pacific&#x20;

#### Nationwide Chapters

These chapters are formed by the contribution of the Initium community in a given country. For example, Initium USA Chapter is a member of the North America Chapter.&#x20;

### How Can I Apply for Establishing a Chapter?

* You should be at least an [Initium Ambassador](how-to-join-initium.md#ambassadors).&#x20;
