# Versions Design

At the time of writing this article, the Initium network is in the laboratory phase and the Initium Lab and Initium Foundation teams work on developing the initial codes of the project. Therefore, the Initium network concept and codes will evolve time by time to achieve an outstanding structure for being available to the public.&#x20;

As a result, the Initium project is subjected to various versions, each may vary from another. Currently, the Initium Foundation has approved a three-phased roadmap to project the future of the Initium, including Inanis, Primus, and Genesis.&#x20;

These three versions are considered the main branches of the Initium and they would have various subversions which will be pointed with the X.Y.Z method, which generally corresponds to major.minor.patch:

* Major version numbers change whenever there is some significant change being introduced. For example, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to a software package.
* Minor version numbers change when a new, minor feature is introduced or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
* Patch numbers change when a new build of the software is released to customers. This is normally for small bug fixes or the like.

### Initium Inanis&#x20;

Inanis is a Latin word that means "the Void." This name is adopted for the lab version of the Initium since it is not yet launchable as a mainnet.&#x20;

The Initium Inanis' main focus is on developing the codes and structuring the network architecture to achieve an outstanding basis for developing the next Version, Initium Primus, for launching the Initium testnet.&#x20;

Initium Inanis whitepaper is available on [https://inanis.initium.foundation](https://inanis.initium.foundation). Inanis has a very active repository on the [Initium Labs GitHub](https://github.com/Initium-Labs) and is updated frequently by the Initium Foundation.&#x20;

Initium Inanis is currently based on Rust language, however, the Initium Foundation may develop other forks of the Initium using GO language.&#x20;

### Initium Primus&#x20;

Primus is a Latin word that means "the Rising." Initium version Primus is considered to be the Testnet version of Initium. This version will be developed when the Inanis development, testing, and bug fixing accomplish successfully.&#x20;

Initium Primus enables the developers to deploy their applications and smart contracts on Initium Testnet. Calibra will be the name of the first testnet of Initium. Like Ethereum, the Initium Foundation plans to provide the developers with various testnets which means the development of testnets will be an ongoing project among the Initium developer teams.&#x20;

In this phase, a wide range of platforms, add-ons, extensions, and dApps will be developed and launched on the testnet to be prepared for the mainnet launch.&#x20;

The whitepaper of Initium Primus will be available upon its complication by the Initium Foundation.&#x20;

### Initium Genesis

Genesis is the live version of the Initium network which makes it accessible for all users and network participants to benefit from the Initium blockchain ecosystem. The launch of the Initium Genesis will be with the mining of the genesis block of the Initium and the official coin generation event of Initium.&#x20;

"Orion" will be the name of the Initium mainnet that enables an end-to-end collaboration between the network participants, including the validators, pools, nodes, etc.&#x20;
