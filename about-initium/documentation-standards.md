# Documentation Standards

The Initium Foundation is the official body for publication of the Initium documentation, including the whitepapers, technical papers, instructions, manuals, code of conduct, etc.&#x20;

Various kinds of documentation standards in the Initium network will be described in this section.&#x20;

### Whitepaper&#x20;

A white paper, also called "whitepaper," is an informational document usually issued by a company or not-for-profit organization to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service it offers or plans to offer. White papers are often written as sales and marketing documents to entice or persuade potential customers to learn more about or purchase a particular product, service, technology, or methodology. They are designed to be used as a marketing tool before a sale and not as a user manual or other technical document developed to support the user after making a purchase.

### Lightpaper&#x20;

A light paper, also called "lightpaper," is a document that describes the architecture of an application. This documentation also provides general guidance for developers, which means it has to be easy to read and understand by non-technical team members. A well-written light paper can help reduce project risks because everyone involved in development will know what's expected from them before they start working on the product or feature.

### Release Note

A release note refers to the technical documentation produced and distributed alongside the launch of a new software product or a product update (e.g., recent changes, feature enhancements, or bug fixes) on the Initium ecosystem. It briefly describes a new product or succinctly details specific changes in a product update.

### Project Proposal&#x20;

A project proposal is a written document outlining everything stakeholders should know about a project, including the timeline, budget, objectives, and goals. The developer team uses the project proposals in the Initium ecosystem to get support from the Initium community, including their participation in the ICO, IDO, IGO, or IEO. The proposals that could receive the support in the Initium DAO votings would be eligible to be reviewed by the Initium Foundation to benefit from the financial and technical support of the Initium Funds and the partner VCs.&#x20;

The approved project proposals will be presented as ecosystem candidates on the Initium Labs' official website. The Initium Labs will supervise the development, fundraising, use of funds, pre-launch, launch, and post-launch of such projects on behalf of the Initium community to ensure the progress and the honesty of the project team.&#x20;

### Request for Proposal (RFP)

A request for proposal (RFP) is a business document that announces a project, describes it, and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it. RFPs are used for complex projects, often requiring several sub-contractors. They represent the organization issuing the RFP, the project's scope, and the criteria for evaluating entries. They also outline the bidding process and the contract terms.

The requests include a statement of work describing the tasks to be performed by the winning bidder and the timeline for finishing the work.

RFPs will be published on the InitiumWorks official website, where the eligible developers through the Initium ecosystem can bid their proposals and prices to the clients.&#x20;

### Technical Documentation

Technical documentation is any piece of writing that describes the application, purpose, creation, or architecture of a product or service. Its goal is to explain something that an organization offers. Several types of technical documents are intended for a specific audience. Writing technical papers is usually the responsibility of technical writers, project managers, members of a development team, or experts on the product or service in question.

Proper technical documentation is mandatory for any project wishing to be officially announced and supported by the Initium Foundation and the community.&#x20;

### DAO Proposal&#x20;

Please read [DAO Proposals](https://www.initium.wiki/about-initium/dao#dao-proposals).&#x20;

### Where do we store all documentation?

Depending on the type of documentation, they will be stored on Initium's official websites and available to the public. A copy of the Initium documentation will be stored on GitHub for future reference.&#x20;
