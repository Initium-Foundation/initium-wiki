# Code of Conduct

The following document indicates the Initium Developers Code of Conduct, which should be respected in all contributions and projects in the Initium ecosystem.

### Our Pledge <a href="#our-pledge" id="our-pledge"></a>

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, developers, and maintainers of the Initium ecosystem projects pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity, and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other people's private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

We pledge to prioritize marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

* 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia.'
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'I'm not discussing this with you.'
* Someone's refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
* Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting the team by emailing [dev@initium.foundation](mailto:dev@initium.foundation). All reports will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to suspend temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
