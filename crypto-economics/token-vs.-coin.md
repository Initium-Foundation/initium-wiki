# Token vs. Coin

In this document, we may refer to INITIUM (INI) as the INITIUM token (INI token) or INITIUM coin (INI coin). Therefore this is useful to clarify what are the differences between them.&#x20;

First of all, let's have a look at the coin and token definition.

### Coin Definition <a href="#head2" id="head2"></a>

So to understand the crypto token vs. coin difference, let’s first define what a coin is.

**A crypto coin is a crypto asset (crypto asset refers to all kinds of cryptos) that has its own blockchain**, as opposed to running on another crypto asset’s blockchain. You could also call a crypto coin a cryptocurrency or a “native token” (confusing, we know) - the underlying idea is that the asset has its own blockchain.

The best-known example of a coin in the blockchain space is Bitcoin, the original crypto coin/cryptocurrency. Other examples include Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero.

### Token Definition <a href="#head3" id="head3"></a>

And so if a coin (otherwise known as a cryptocurrency or native token), has its own blockchain, a **token is the opposite: it runs on another blockchain**.

The best-known example of this is the [ERC20 token](../appendix/glossary-of-terms.md#erc-20), which is any token that uses the Ethereum blockchain. Some of the best-known ERC-20 tokens are USDT, USDC, Dai, BAT, etc.

### Token vs. Coin: The Difference <a href="#head5" id="head5"></a>

The simple explanation of the difference between coin vs. token is that a coin has its own blockchain, while a token doesn’t.

Another thing to note is that coins usually are used for 1 thing (payments), while tokens have various use cases, which can include payments but also other things. For instance, when comparing a coin or cryptocurrency vs. a utility token, utility tokens are used to access a product or service.

For example, the Basic Attention Token (BAT) is used in the Brave web browser ecosystem. Advertisers pay publishers with audiences in BAT, audience members receive BAT for viewing advertisers’ ads, and audience members can use that BAT to donate to publishers or keep the BAT for themselves.

Other uses for tokens include:

* Security tokens - like securities from the traditional financial system (TradFi), these represent shares of a company but with all the benefits of blockchain.
* Asset tokens - tokens that are backed by real-world assets like gold or real estate.
* Stablecoins - tokens that represent more stable - at least relative to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - currencies, such as the US Dollar or Euro. Examples are USDT, BUSD, USDC, and Dai.
* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - NFTs represent things that are unique like art, baseball cards, and in-game items (think “virtual real estate” or unique virtual pets).

### What type of token is the INITIUM Token?

The INITIUM (INI) Token is defined as utility and governance token which several functionalities including:

* Utilities: to be used as the means of payments within the Initium community, protocol-related platforms, and partner platforms.&#x20;
* Governance: to be used for voting in the Initium DAO.&#x20;
* Staking: to receive the staking rewards from the staking platforms.&#x20;

### When INITIUM Token will be converted to INITIUM Coin?

By launching the mainnet of the Initium network, the owners of Initium (INI) Tokens can convert them to INITIUM (INI) Coins by a 1:1 ratio via the Initium Bridge. In addition, by integrating the Initium network with centralized exchanges, the owners also can convert their tokens on such platforms too.

### What will happen to INITIUM Tokens if not converted?

The owners of the Initium (INI) tokens can hold their tokens as long as they want, but due to the changes to the staking programs on the Initium protocol, they no longer will be able to receive the staking rewards as such rewards will be paid to the staked INITIUM (INI) Coins. Therefore, we strongly suggest conducting the conversion to benefit from the staking rewards.&#x20;

### What is Wrapped INITIUM (wINI)?

Wrapped tokens are assets that allow the value of a native asset from one blockchain to transfer to another blockchain. One of the best-known wrapped tokens is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). wBTC is pegged 1:1 to the price of Bitcoin (BTC) so that one wBTC should always equal one BTC.

The wrapping function enables the owners of the INITIUM tokens/coins to migrate their tokens/coins from one blockchain to another. For example, if you HODL the INI token of the ERC-20 version, you can easily convert it to the BEF-20 or TRC-20 version to be used on another blockchain. This function is conducted by using the RedWard platform of the Initium protocol. The wapping process will convert INI by a 1:1 ratio.&#x20;

After launching the mainnet of the Initium network, the owners of INITIUM (INI) coins can wrap their coins for using them on the other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) for being used on the compatible DeFi platforms for trading, lending, staking, etc. This operation will be conducted by using the RedWap platform of the Initium network.&#x20;
